0.106u1
-------

IMPORTANT NOTE: Major video-related changes are beginning in the
system. Attempts will be made to keep the existing video code
working to a large degree, but some features may be broken or
working improperly until the video changes are complete. Most
notably, in this release, RGB effects are broken for non-Direct3D
blitting. For the moment, do not report anomalies or problems in 
the video system. If you like a nice, stable MAME, please stick 
with the 0.106 release. You have been warned.



MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------

Source Changes
--------------
Updates to the taito_x driver: [AWJ]
 - fixed sound problems in twinhawk
 - fixed a couple of dipswitch mistakes introduced recently
 - added PORT_DIPLOCATIONs for superman and twinhawk

Improved MSVC compiler support: [Nathan Woods]
 - modified vconv to support multiple versions of MSVC based on 
    version info
 - added support for more parameter translations
 - makefile now displays compiling and linking messages when
    building vconv

Converted the Windows blitters to use the DRC engine for 
generation. RGB effects are officially broken with this change.
[Nathan Woods]

Fixed a bug that caused a crash when the -debugscript command line 
option was used with an invalid filename. [Nathan Woods]

Corrected the ordering of the DIP_PORTLOCATION() macros to be
consistent. Multi-bit DIP switches should be specified in LSB-
first order. Added a comment to this effect in inptport.h.
[AWJ, Aaron Giles]

Fixed background color in the Deco cassette games.
[Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed potential crash in the micro3d driver. [MamePlus!]

Improvements to CHD-CD support: [R. Belmont]
 - additional RAW CD sector conversion support, so a game can request 
    e.g. 2048-byte data sectors from a RAW CHD-CD and still get the 
    right data
- reversed CHDMAN error message - now non-RAW CHD-CDs are deprecated
- susume now uses a RAW CHD-CD read directly from an original pressed 
   Konami disc

Some improvements to the Polygonet Commanders driver: [Andrew Gardner]
 - adds change_PC() calls to the dsp56k core
 - removed hacky dsp56k initialization, enabling, and disabling
 - added preliminary implementation of banking hardware tied to the 
    dsp56k in Polygonet Commanders

Fixed MSB accesses and latch reading in the 6840 emulator. [El Condor]

Improved N64 audio output: [R. Belmont]
 - rewrote Audio Interface as a stereo DMADAC (which it actually is), 
    greatly simplifying the code along the way
 - fixed AI interrupt semantics

Changed a number of games that were incorrectly using IPT_LIGHTGUN
to use IPT_AD_STICK instead. [Aaron Giles]

Some preparations for proper multiple screen support. The 
visible_area and refresh_rate values in the Machine structure are
now defined as arrays (1 per screen). The machine_config structure
has been altered as well, removing the following fields:

   frames_per_second
   aspect_x, aspect_y
   screen_width, screen_height
   default_visible_area
   vblank_duration

These are all stored per-screen in a new screen_config structure. 
[Aaron Giles]

Reorganized the user interface code to better support the new render
system. [Aaron Giles]
