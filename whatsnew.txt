Source Changes
--------------
Added an API to access the current amiga_machine_interface.
[Nathan Woods]

Added more static qualifiers to core files. [Atari Ace]

Fixed reversed clock speeds in mexico86. [Brian Troha]

Changed malloc tracking to be decided at runtime in a function 
use_malloc_tracking(). This makes it easy to turn it on or off by 
recompiling only a single file. [Nathan Woods]

Split up MSVC inline assembler functions into MSVC specific headers, 
and removed the assumption that Window's osinline.h would only be 
used by MSVC. [Nathan Woods]

Optimized the hyperstone core, gaining ~50% speed improvement in most
games. Implemented clock prescaling and corrected interrupt priority
handling. Then fixed the clock speeds on the most of the games and
killed most of the speed gains in quite a number of them. (Sorry!)
[Aaron Giles]

Added explicit Core2 architecuture support to the makefile (CORE2=1).
Note that gcc 4.2.0 doesn't understand core 2, so this is equivalent
to compiling with pentium-m architecture and -sse3. Also note that
compiling native on a Core2 is not what you want because native will
think you are on a Prescott, which is P4-era hardware. [Aaron Giles]

Changed alignment of rgbint values in the namcos22 driver to work
around 32-bit gcc's lack of proper alignment handling. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed attotime routines to use unsigned math for multiply/divide,
solving problems with some games which errantly passed in -1 for the
factor. The new behavior matches the original behavior. [Aaron Giles]

Renamed colortable to colortable_t. Added a Machine->colortable
entry to hold the global colortable for games that use it. Updated
several more drivers to just use palettes directly rather than 
hacking colortables. [Aaron Giles]
