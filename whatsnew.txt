NeoGeo Support
--------------

You need a zip file called neogeo.zip in your rompath.  It should contain at
least three files:

neo-geo.rom (128k)
ng-sfix.rom (128k)
ng-sm1.rom (128k)

Important!  The bios zip file must be called neogeo.zip NOT neo-geo.zip, ie,
there should be no dash in the middle.

You also need to place the game zip in your rompath.  If you do not know what 8
character filename the NeoGeo game you want to play has you can type:

mame -listclones neogeo

That will list the 8 character zip names of all currently supported games.

- Optional rom loading of samples:  You may find games that do
  not work now due to lack of memory as all the sound roms need to be loaded.
  Some games will require an extra 16 megabytes of memory to load the sound
  roms. You can force Mame NOT to load these samples if you specify no sound
  BEFORE rom loading takes place.  In Dos this means you must type:

  mame game -soundcard 0

  If you DO NOT specify soundcard 0 then all sound roms will be loaded and
  you may experience memory problems.

- All games work, both in arcade and home mode. If you are stuck with a
  copyright message or the coin inputs don't work, delete the .CFG and .HI file
  for that game. This will fix the problem.
  Super Sidekicks controls stop working after a couple of minutes, though.

- Sound support is 99% complete. If you experience garbled sound and you get
  NO GOOD DUMP EXISTS errors, this is caused by bad ROMs, not by imperfect
  emulation. There is NO WAY to fix that apart from redumping the bad ROMs.

- If you get a Z80 ERROR message, it means that the sound program ROM is bad.
  Run the game without sound.

- A few games have graphics glitches which are not easily fixed (raster line
  effects).

- "ROM length mismatch" errors. If you get these, and you are using ROMs
  larger than the ones MAME expects, then this is not a fatal error and the
  game will still run fine (provided the ROMs are good, of course). You can
  "fix" the ROMs yourself just by removing the second half of the file.
  Note that the sizes used by MAME are sort of arbitrary. In many cases it is
  difficult to know for sure which size the ROMs are really supposed to be, so
  we decided to consistently use the smallest possible files. The real ROMs
  *might* be larger than that, but the extra space is not used by the game -
  it is either all FF, or contains a verbatim copy of the first half.

- Scion, Stinger. [Zsolt Vasvari]



Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- The original Elevator Action now works, using the 68705 mcu ROM which was
  missing. Since there is one additional CPU to emulate, it is slower than the
  bootleg version. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Replaced Front Line with the complete set containing the 68705 code. It
  still doesn't work though. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Replaced Golden Star with the original, encrypted set. [Mirko Buffoni]

- Improvements to the System 8 driver. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Front Line and Tin Star have the aiming dial (using a dual joystick setup).
  Also, you can now kill and be killed in Front Line. However, collision
  detection is not accurately emulated. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed ending in Robocop. [JC Alexander]

- *FINALLY* fixed Commando sometimes not starting. It was a bug in the decode
  routine, which has been completely rewritten. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improved Gladiator input handling. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Improved the System 16 drivers. [Phil Stroffolino]

- Fixed movement of the squares in Checkman. [Brad Oliver]

- Fixed hang on level 7 of Discs of Tron. [Jim Thevenot]

- Fixed Blasto. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Chelnov is now playable! Plus many other fixes to the driver including
  slowdowns in Karnov. [Bryan McPhail]

- Fixed srumbler2. [Paul Leaman]

- Several improvements and bug fixes to the Data East 68000 games (Midnight
  Resistance, Bad Dudes, Robocop, etc.). [Bryan McPhail]

- Fixed resetting bug in Triple Punch. [Zsolt Vasvari]



Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Fixed a bug in the NOT instruction of the 68000 core. [Mike Coates]

- You can proceed from the "press OK to continue" screen by pushing left then
  right. You can also immediately quit by pressing ESC. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Vector translucency can be turned off with -notranslucency.
  [Valerio Verrando]

- [DOS] New -romident option. Use "MAME -romident dirname" to identify unknown
  ROM sets.

- Switched to CRC-32 for file integrity checks. The old custom checksums are no
  longer used. [John Butler, Bernd Wiebelt]

- When using zipped files, ROMs are automatically retrieved even if they don't
  have the expected name (provided they have the correct CRC-32, of course).
  You'll never have to rename files any more (though you might have to rename
  zips ;-) [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] New command -listcrc. It lists the CRC-32 for all the supported ROMs.
  00000000 means that the ROM is known to be bad. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed bug in the 68000 interrupt handling which caused Rastan Saga to not
  boot correctly. [Brad Oliver]

- [DOS] Profiler. To enable it, use the -profiler parameter; then,
  hit Left Shift + F11 to show the results on screen.
  The profiler REQUIRES the Pentium-class RDTSC instruction. It will not work
  on 486s, older Pentiums, and maybe other non-Intel CPUs. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improved the user interface. Use "the key on the left of 1" (tilde on some
  leyboards) to turn on the On Screen Display which lets you change Volume,
  Gamma Correction, Brightess, and independently set the volume levels of the
  sound chips. Tab still brings up the setup menu, which is now asynchronous.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] Replaced the -fm option with -ym2203opl. Added -noym3812opl to use the
  digital emulation of the YM3812 instead of the SoundBlaster OPL chip. Note
  that with -noym3812opl you also need external drum samples. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Clone sets are not reported as missing by -verifyroms if only the parent set
  is present. [John Butler]

- [DOS] Stereo sound support. It is a little slower than mono, to turn it off
  use -nostereo. Stereo is enabled only for games which really need it. The
  others always use mono.

- [DOS] New -listinfo command to give details on all of the supported games.
  [Andrea Mazzoleni]

- Several changes to the cheat system, you'll have to download a new cheat
  database if you want to use it. [Stephane Humbert]

- [DOS] Now using a new beta version of the SEAL audio library which further
  improves the dynamic range. You'll notice louder and better balanced sound
  in many games. Let me know about games with bad balance.
  The new library should also fix problems with the ENSONIQ AudioPCI and
  Creative PCI64 cards. [Nicola Salmoria]

- When using the SoundBlaster OPL chip, YM3812 commands are converted to play
  at the correct frequency. [Carl-Henrik Skårstedt]

- Joystick calibration is available in the Tab menu.



Source:
-------

- Moved the Sega encryption code used by Flicky, Future Spy, and many others,
  to machine/segacrpt.c. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added memory_region_length field to the RunningMachine structure. This could
  be useful for drivers which handle several games on similar hardware.
  [Nicola Salmoria]


- TMS34010 emulator. [Alex Pasadyn, Zsolt Vasvari]

- Replaced the 6502 emulator with a new one which also supports 65C02 and 6510.
  Marat Fayzullin's core is no longer used. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Fixed a bug in the 68000 BCD emulation which caused the F1 Dream timer to
  malfunction. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed bug in the Z80 block I/O instructions (INI, IND, INIR, INDR, OUTI,
  OUTD, OTIR, and OTDR). [Frank Palazzolo]

- [DOS] Rearranged the makefile using archives to work around E2BIG error on
  some machines. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Improved unzip code robustness when dealing with corrupt archives.
  [John Butler]

- Fixed SBCD in M68000 disassembler. [Mike Coates]

- New unzip interface. New zip directory cache and filename cache (the latter
  only in the DOS version). [Andrea Mazzoleni]

- New streams.c to abstract audio streams. This makes them easier to use and
  more efficient. osd_play_streamed_sample() should now be considered a private
  function and should not be used in new code. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed bug in the I8039 external interrupt handling. [Dan Boris]

- New file types for osd_fopen(): OSD_FILETYPE_STATE and OSD_FILETYPE_ARTWORK.

- x86 ASM 68000 core. This is a major speed improvement. [Mike Coates, Darren
  Olafson]

- YM3812 and YM3526 software emulator. In the DOS version it is disabled
  by default because we are using the 100% compatible SoundBlaster OPL chip.
  [Carl-Henrik Skårstedt]

- A begginning for a YM2413 emulator. It pushes data through the YM3812.
  [Paul Leaman, Ernesto Corvi]

- I86 disassembler for the debugger, based on code by Robin Hilliard.
  [Andrea Mazzoleni]

- New functions install_mem_read_handler() and install_mem_write_handler().
  They can be used to install special memory handlers (for example, to trap
  busy loops, or to make small changes to the memory map for games running
  on similar hardware). [Alex Pasadyn]

- New field driver_init in the GameDriver structure. It's an optional function
  which can be used to do some game specific initialization, for example by
  adding memory handlers using the above functions. [Nicola Salmoria]

- YM2610 emulator. This is used by the NeoGeo games. [Hiromitsu Shioya]

- TMS9900 emulator. [Andy Jones, based on original code by Ton Brouwer]
