Source Changes
--------------
Fixed bug in screenless systems. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed crash in chd code if reading beyond the end of the file.
[Roman Scherzer]

Moved Sand Scorpian and Gals Panic over to use the Pandora emulation.
Also fixed some problems in the pandora emulation which improves the 
sprites in Djboy. [David Haywood]

Added new function timer_call_after_resynch(), which effectively
sets a zero-duration timer for resynchronization. Replaced instances
of zero-duration timers in the code with this more descriptive call.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Defined new macro TIMER_CALLBACK, which should be used to wrap
timer callbacks. Added a running_machine * parameter to timer 
callbacks. Updated all existing timer callbacks to use the new
macro. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added more opcode decryption to gussun. [Robiza]

Added discrete sound to headon and clones in vicdual.c. [couriersud]

Added two inverter oscillators supporting enable and mixing in signals
to discrete.h / disc_wav.c. [couriersud]

Fixed a few bugs in the change lanes video emulation. [Adam Bousley]

Updated the monzagp driver into a somewhat playable state. There are
still some graphics problems. LEDs still need to be hooked up for
score/time-remaining display. [Phil Stroffolino]

Neo-Geo update: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 - BIOS only driver 'neogeo' no longer crashes
 - Cleaned up memory banking code to use memory_set_bank() instead 
    of memory_set_bank_ptr()
 - Fixed LEDs

Improvements to the toaplan2 driver: [Alex Jackson]
 - Replaced byteswapped truxton2 M68K program ROM with correct one
 - Fixed sound CPU communications in the Raizing games. This is 
    educated guesswork, but it's more complete and probably more
    correct than what was there before, and doesn't rely on excessive 
    use of cpu_yield()
 - Added more information about the Raizing sets to the comments in 
    the driver, and corrected some errors
 - Reorganized the Battle Garegga sets in a more sensible fashion

Reworked input system to push more features into the core. Cleaned
up architecture to properly separate dependencies. Please note that
this change only addresses the lower layer of input handling. The
upper layer (i.e., input port handling at the driver layer) remains
the same. [Aaron Giles]

Major changes include:

  * Removed the concept of os_code from the system. Now all codes
    are defined via a set of macros in input.h. Each code is a 32-bit
    value that encodes a device class, device index, item class,
    item modifier, and item ID.
    
  * Removed OSD functions osd_get_code_list() and osd_get_code_value().
    Instead, the OSD layer during osd_init() must register one or more
    devices and the input items attached to each device via two new
    functions input_device_add() and input_device_item_add().
    
  * Separated input sequence code into new module inputseq.c.
    
  * Moved support for the following options into the core: -mouse,
    -joystick, -lightgun, -steadykey, -offscreen_reload, -joy_deadzone,
    -joy_saturation, -paddle_device, -adstick_device, -pedal_device,
    -dial_device, -trackball_device, -lightgun_device, 
    -positional_device, -mouse_device. The OSD layer should simply 
    register all devices at osd_init() time and allow the core to 
    enable/disable them according to the options.
  
  * Added two new options: -multikeyboard and -multimouse. By default,
    both options are OFF. When OFF, the core will combine all keyboard
    or mouse input into a single keyboard or mouse device. When ON,
    these options instruct the core to keep inputs for each keyboard
    and/or mouse independent.
    
  * Added new option: -joystick_map. This option allows for a 9x9 grid
    to be specified which controls analog-to-digital mapping of 
    joystick inputs.
    
  * Changed the Windows implementation of input handling to fully
    support the raw input interfaces for keyboard and mouse. 
    DirectInput is still used for all joystick inputs, as well as for
    keyboard and mouse inputs on pre-Windows XP systems. This allows
    for multiple keyboards and mice to be supported. Also changed
    keyboard and mouse behavior to use non-exclusive mode in 
    DirectInput, and to keep the devices alive during pause for more
    consistent input handling.

  * Broke windows.txt into config.txt, which contains all common
    core-supported options and commmands, and windows.txt, which now
    only lists Windows-specific additions.

Added support for frame update callbacks, similar to pause and exit
callbacks but called at the same time as osd_update(). [Aaron Giles]

Changed osd_init() to no longer return a value. OSD initialization
should now rely on fatalerror() to report fatal initialization
problems. [Aaron Giles]

Added new function mame_schedule_new_driver() which allows for a new
driver to be queued after a hard reset. [Aaron Giles]

Added experimental new minimal game selection user interface. This
interface can be accessed if MAME is started with no parameters, or
via the main menu by choosing "Select a New Game". This interface
allows you to select a game driver by typing in the name of the game.
As you type, MAME's fuzzy name matching code will list the top 15
selections that match. The interface will only display games that
it finds in your rompath. [Aaron Giles]

Added "empty" driver which is used to host the game selection screen
when no valid game is selected. [Aaron Giles]

Changed behavior in the Windows build so that double-clicking on
MAME brings up the new game selection interface. [Aaron Giles]

Removed the NOT_A_DRIVER flag which was overloaded to mean two 
different things. There are now two new flags: GAME_IS_BIOS_ROOT
indicates that a particular driver represents a BIOS rather than
a full game. And GAME_NO_STANDALONE indicates that the given driver
should not be listed or permitted to execute on its own. For MAME,
most BIOSes are executable on their own, so they have the
GAME_IS_BIOS_ROOT flag set but not the GAME_NO_STANDALONE flag.
[Aaron Giles]

Added new routines mame_openpath(), mame_readpath(), and 
mame_closepath() for iterating over all files in a path specification,
including support for multiple paths. [Aaron Giles]

Changed audit interfaces to take a game_driver * instead of a game
index. [Aaron Giles]

Changed driver_get_approx_matches() and driver_get_count() APIs to
work on arbitrary driver lists rather than being hard-coded to the
static driver list. Renamed the functions from driver_get_* to
driver_list_get_* [Aaron Giles]
