Sync Refresh / Waitvsync / Triplebuffer changes [Alan Kamrowski II]

 * It changes the waitvsync code to wait for the beginning of the vertical
blank.  The previous code simply checked if it was in the vblank and only
waited if it wasn't.  This caused 2 problems.  The first is that when using
syncrefresh, if there was enough time, more than one frame can be rendered
during a single vblank.  This is why syncrefresh would have odd behavior
such as the game speeding up or slowing during during less cpu intensive
sequences.  The second problem is that the retrace line could sometimes be
seen because while the code checked to see if it was in the vblank, it did
not check where in the vblank it was so it might be at the end of the vblank
and by time the frame is rendered the monitor could be out of the vblank.

 * It removes the waitvsync only if game speed is above 95% restriction.
This restriction would only cause waitvsync to vacillate between on and off
depending on game speed.  If someone enables waitvsync and it is too slow,
then it is.

 * When syncrefresh and triplebuffer are used, MAME would run the waitvsync
code anyway.  The triplebuffer code takes care of this and having MAME wait
for the retrace in the waitvsync code anyway is a waste of time and causes
timing issues on some hardware.  If triplebuffering is enabled, then there
is no need to run the waitvsync code because triplebuffer already does.

MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
upsidedown0103yel [Mamesick]



Source Changes
--------------
Major cleanup/rewrite of the Berzerk driver: [smf]
 * merged memory & io read/write maps.
 * video ram & magic ram share the same memory.
 * hooked up nvram in frenzy memory map.
 * emulates magic ram shifter/flopper with 9 74LS153's as per the 
    schematics.
 * emulates magic ram alu with 2 74LS181's hardwired to logic mode as 
    per the schematics.
 * 74LS181 emulation based on the logic diagram from the datasheet, 
    supporting logic mode & arithmetic mode

Fixed Thunderstrike interrupts, visible area, and raster updates. 
[Bryan McPhail]

Updates for the ARM core: [Bryan McPhail]
 * Fixed software interrupts.
 * Fixed several mode change bugs.
 * Preliminary coprocessor support.

Deco fixes: [Bryan McPhail, Pierpaolo Prazzoli] 
 * Deco MLC video hardware near perfect for the most part, however no game 
    works properly because of an unemulated math coprocessor attached to 
    the DE156 chip.
 * Deco 32: Night Slashers pretty much perfect apart from lack of sound.  
 * Deco 32: Some graphics fixes for Tattoo Assassins.
 * Deco 156: Heavy Smash pretty much perfect.
