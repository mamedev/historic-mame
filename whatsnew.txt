Source:
-------

- [DOS] Now using version 1.05 of the SEAL audio library. This should fix
  problems with the ENSONIQ AudioPCI and Creative PCI64 cards.

- YM2610 emulator. This is used by the NeoGeo games. [Hiromitsu Shioya]

- TMS9900 emulator. [Andy Jones, based on original code by Ton Brouwer]


NeoGeo Support
--------------

This beta contains some major improvements to the neogeo emulation.  Work on
this driver also uncovered several bad rom dumps, most of which you can correct
yourself, existing bad rom dumps should still work but will give checksum and/or
rom length errors on startup.

How to:

You need a zip file called neogeo.zip in your rompath.  It should contain at
least three files:

neo-geo.rom (128k)
ng-sfix.rom (128k)
ng-sm1.rom (128k)

The rom 'ng-sm1.rom' is badly dumped in many archives, you will need one that is
128k, see later for full details on bad roms.  Using a 256k rom will still work
but will give a length & checksum error on every game.

Important!  The bios zip file must be called neogeo.zip NOT neo-geo.zip, ie,
there should be no dash in the middle.

You also need to place the game zip in your rompath.  If you do not know what 8
character filename the NeoGeo game you want to play has you can type:

mame -listclones neogeo

That will list the 8 character zip names of all currently supported games.

What's New?
-----------

* FULL sound support, FM synth and ADPCM samples, on 90% of games using the
YM2610 emulator.  The games without working sound should be fixed soon.

- Optional rom loading of samples:  You may find games that worked before will
not work now due to lack of memory as all the sound roms need to be loaded.
Some games will require an extra 16 megabytes of memory to load the sound roms.
You can force Mame NOT to load these samples if you specify no sound BEFORE rom
loading takes place.  In Dos this means you must type:

mame game -soundcard 0

If you DO NOT specify soundcard 0 then all sound roms will be loaded and you may
experience memory problems.

* Improved graphics:

- Auto-animations are supported, these are used in many games.  The Neogeo
graphics hardware can cause animation without intervention from the main cpu.
You can see this in the backgrounds of games such as Karnov's Revenge, Street
Hoops, Samurai Shodown, King Of Fighters, etc.

- Very accurate scaling support, including full screen zooms.

- No more 'missing tiles' on zoomed graphics.

- MAJOR speedup!  You should see at least 20-50% increase on all games.  The downside is
you will see a black screen for a few seconds at the start of every game as
the graphics are converted to a custom format.  There are many other
optimisations in the video code too.

- Fixed bug in y-flipped tiles glitched when y<0 (Thrash Rally)

* All games for which rom dumps are available are now supported.  99% of them
are working.

* Several games have experimental 68000 idle cycle skipping, for these games you
should see increases of between 5% and 20%.  Games currently using this method
are:
	Puzzle De Pon
	Karnov's Revenge
	Wind Jammers
	Street Hoops
	Neo Bomberman

* SRAM save size has been reduced to 0x2000 bytes from 0x10000.  The NeoGeo
has 8 memory frames and will store sram data for upto 8 games regardless
of how many physical cartridges the machine can take.  The Mame emulation
emulates a fixed 1 cartridge neogeo, therefore only the first 0x2000
bytes of the SRAM should ever be used.  Due to bullet-proofed(!) memory
handling there should be no more corrupt sram saves either.  Remember you can
delete a game settings by deleting it's file in the 'hi' directory.

Bug where SRAM states were reloaded upon every reset is fixed.

Known Problems/To Do:
---------------------

Some games will give a piracy warning.  You can still play the games if you
set them to run in Console (Home) mode.  For some games you can set the game
back to arcade mode after the protection check is done and leave it that
way (because some games leave a flag in SRAM as to whether the game has passed
it's security check).

Line (row) scrolling is not implemented.  This is used for the floor in
Karnov's Revenge, special effects in Spinmasters, etc, and many others.

The calendar chip is not yet implemented.

This release should give a substantial speed boost over previous betas, and there
are some more optimisation ideas to be tried.

Bad Roms
--------

Several bad rom dumps have been found, this is where a rom has corrupt data
and may also be the wrong size.  'Fixed' rom dumps will become available from
the usual places in time.  The most common error is that a rom is twice the
size it should be, and that the second half is either the same as the first or
just has junk in it.  To be fix these roms you simply split them in half, and
throw away the second half.  You should do a binary split, meaning your split
program should not save any formatting information to the file.  As mentioned
above bad rom dumps will continue to work but will give checkums and length
errors.

The Neorage team will support all fixes to the bad roms and make sure their
emulator is compatible.  Most fixed romsets will work on Neorage already.

  Gamma Correction, Brightess, and independently set the volume levels of the
  sound chips. Tab still brings up the setup menu, which is now asynchronous.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] Improved the profiler. It now REQUIRES the Pentium-class RDTSC
  instruction. It will not work on 486s, older Pentiums, and maybe other
  non-Intel CPUs. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- x86 ASM 68000 core. This is a major speed improvement. [Mike Coates, Darren
  Olafson]

- YM3812 and YM3526 software emulator. In the DOS version it is disabled
  because we are using the 100% compatible SoundBlaster OPL chip.
  [Carl-Henrik Skårstedt]

- A begginning for a YM2413 emulator. It pushes data through the YM3812.
  [Paul Leaman, Ernesto Corvi]

- I86 disassembler for the debugger, based on code by Robin Hilliard.
  [Andrea Mazzoleni]

- New functions install_mem_read_handler() and install_mem_write_handler().
  They can be used to install special memory handlers (for example, to trap
  busy loops, or to make small changes to the memory map for games running
  on similar hardware). [Alex Pasadyn]

- New field driver_init in the GameDriver structure. It's an optional function
  which can be used to do some game specific initialization, for example by
  adding memory handlers using the above functions. [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the cheat system [Stephane Humbert]

New in MAME 034b4 :
  * Possibility of "circular" values in search method 1:
     - if you press OSD_KEY_LEFT or OSD_KEY_DOWN when value is 0, it turns to
0xFF
     - if you press OSD_KEY_RIGHT or OSD_KEY_UP when value is 0xFF, it turns to
0.
  * Added the possibility of toggling the watches display ON (Insert) and OFF
(Del) .
  * Possibility to work on another cheat file (CHEAT.DAT is just the default
one) by using option "-cheatfile xx"
  * Added new types of cheats:
     - 20-24 : same as 0-4 but they force bits to 1
     - 40-44 : same as 0-4 but they force bits to 0.

New in MAME 034b5 :
* 15 active cheats instead of 10.
* Free memory before the start of a new search.
* Possibility of searches in CPUs other than 0 : a question is asked to the
user to choose a CPU (0 default) when he starts a new search and the game has more
than one CPU.
* Possibility to view watches for CPUs other than 0.
* CPU is displayed with the watches.
* Possibility to change the CPU of a watch by pressing 9 (previous CPU) and 0
(next CPU) .
* Possibility to copy a cheat code by pressing F4.
* Possibility to rename the cheat filename by pressing F5.
* Possibility to save all the cheat codes to disk by pressing F6.
* Possibility to remove all the cheat codes from the active list by pressing
F7.
* In the edit cheat, on the data line :
    - Home sets the value to 0
    - End sets the value to 0x80.
* Possibility to use to use Home, End, PgDown and PgUp to select a cheat code
in the list.
* Data is saved on 2 hex digits (%02X) .

- Pleiads colors might be correct now. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Accurate colors in Strategy X. [Gerald Vanderick]

- Preliminary backdrop support in Discs of Tron. The background image must be
  called ARTWORK/DOTRON.PNG. [Mathis Rosenhauer, Brandon Kirkpatrick]

- Fixed sound pitch and tempo in Donkey Kong. [Mirko Buffoni]

- Improved music tempo in SlapFight. [Sebastien Chevalier]

- Improved Cop 01 (tempo is still wrong). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Sound in all of the working System 16 games. [Phil Stroffolino]

- Emulation of the Astrocade sound chip (Gorf, Wizard of Wor, etc.)
  [Frank Palazzolo]

- Improved speech in Gorf. It now plays speech 100% accurately except for the
  missing samples. [Kevin Bales]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

- Nemesis. [Dani Portillo]

- Terra Cresta, Rastan. [Juan Carlos Lorente]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed hang on level 7 of Discs of Tron. [Jim Thevenot]

- Fixed Blasto. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Fixed controls in Stinger. [Miguel Figueiredo]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Switched to CRC-32 for file integrity checks. The old custom checksums are no
  longer used. [John Butler, Bernd Wiebelt]

- New unzip interface. New zip directory cache and filename cache (the latter
  only in the DOS version). [Andrea Mazzoleni]

- When using zipped files, ROMs are automatically retrieved even if they don't
  have the expected name (provided they have the correct CRC-32, of course).
  You'll never have to rename files any more (though you might have to rename
  zips ;-) [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] New command -listcrc. It lists the CRC-32 for all the supported ROMs.
  00000000 means that the ROM is known to be bad. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Some improvements to the cheat system. [Stephane Humbert]

- Fixed bug in the 68000 interrupt handling which causes Rastan Saga to not
  boot correctly. [Brad Oliver]

- [DOS] Experimental profiler. To enable it, use the -profiler parameter; then,
  hit Left Shift + F11 to show the results on screen. I don't know how accurate
  the figures are; the "Sound" figure is certainly underestimated for sound
  chip emulators which don't use streams.c (it is computed under the CPU
  playing the sound instead that under Sound).
  Note that the sum of the percentages is much less than 100%. This is in part
  due to portions of the code which are not profiled, but is also caused by the
  massive overhead of calling uclock() (which happens very often when sound is
  playing). [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- New streams.c to abstract audio streams. This makes them easier to use and
  more efficient. osd_play_streamed_sample() should now be considered a private
  function and should not be used in new code. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Completed the transition to CRC32 checksums. [John Butler, Bernd Weibelt]

- Fixed bug in the I8039 external interrupt handling. [Dan Boris]

- New file types for osd_fopen(): OSD_FILETYPE_STATE and OSD_FILETYPE_ARTWORK.


NeoGeo Mame Support
-------------------

This beta contains a major update to the NeoGeo driver.  It is still far from
perfect but has many improvements over the previous version.  This is still
very much a 'work-in-progress' driver with many known problems.  Hopefully
these problems will be fixed soon.

How to:

You need a zip file called neogeo.zip in your rompath.  It should contain at
least two files:

neo-geo.rom (128k)
ng-sfix.rom (128k)

There should also be two other roms which are not yet used by Mame, they _will_
be used in future versions of this driver so do not delete them.

You also need to place the game zip in your rompath.  If you do not know what 8
character filename the NeoGeo game you want to play has you can type:

mame -listclones neogeo

That will list the 8 character zip names of all currently supported games.

What's New?
-----------

Many graphics improvements:
* 'Missing tiles' in games such as Puzzle Bobble are fixed.
* Scaling is improved, but still not perfect.  Full screen zooms tend to break
  (eg, Thrash Rally, Art of Fighting).
* 'Japan/Europe/USA' territory selection in dipswitch menu.
* Start & coin key positions are moved to their 'standard' MAME positions
* Coin inputs work, freeplay is no longer the default.
* Soft dipswitches are fully emulated and saved per game, the files are saved
  to the hiscore directory for now.
* Custom drawgfx routine in place.  This is slower than the previous MAME
  release but allows the graphics to be drawn from their native data.  This
  allows:
* MEMORY REQUIREMENTS APPROXIMATELY HALVED!  And also quicker loading time.
* If you experience a 'black screen' for a few seconds after loading it is
  because the 'pen usage' arrays are being calculated.  MAME NeoGeo uses a
  compressed palette system to give the full NeoGeo 12 bit colour on an 8 bit
  display.  (This is nothing new, almost every other MAME driver for high
  colour games works in the same way, by choosing only the colours that are
  actually displayed at any one time).  Although this gives better quality it
  actually takes around 10-15% of the processor time each frame.
* There is no 'black screen' at the end of each games demo. All games now
  behave as per the arcade version and cycle to the 'NeoGeo logo' screen.


Notes on soft dipswitches:  You can access these from pressing F2 (self test)
or setting the test mode dipswitch and resetting the virtual machine. Both soft
dips and cabinet settings are saved for each game. If, for some reason, you
experience strange gameplay (NOT graphics glitches), the soft dips may have
become corrupt (this _is_ still a beta release!), to clear them you can wipe
the file in the hiscore directory for the game OR go into the hardware test and
select the 'clear backup ram' option (recommended).

Other Fixes
-----------

Emulation of soft dips fixed many problems games had in previous versions, for
example, the game timers being set low in games such as KOTM and Art of Fighting
are fixed. Almost all 'gameplay' issues are fixed by this.

Sidenote: The 'blood bios' is not needed, nor supported.  All games affected by
the blood bios actually have the 'blood' option in their soft dip options.  It
can be turned on & off there without having to use a special bios.  In fact any
non-standard bios may not work at this point.

Due to the much decreased memory requirements large games such as Karnov's
Revenge now work.

What isn't fixed?
-----------------

'New' games such as Metal Slug, Pulstar, Shock Troopers do not work, either due
to protection or bankswitching used in these games (information needed!).

The animation in the 'rain' scenes of Karnov's Revenge does not animate!

As mentioned before, full screen zooms are not correct.

The MVS memory card is not supported.

(Probably many other small bugs too).

And finally:
------------

Q: Why don't you MAME guys do something original instead of doing something
   that's already done?
A: Tell that to a Mac/Arm/Amiga owner!

Q: It's a bit slow...
A: The custom graphics draw routine will be improved soon! It was felt that the
   slowdown was merited due to the advantages of halving memory usage.

These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- The music in Bubble Bobble seems to stay in sync now. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Dynasty Wars works (actually it was already working, it's just that the dip
  switches had Freeze on by default).

- Front Line and Tin Star have the aiming dial (using a dual joystick setup).
  Also, you can now kill and be killed in Front Line. However, collision
  detection is not accurately emulated. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed ending in Robocop. [JC Alexander]

- *FINALLY* fixed Commando sometimes not starting. It was a bug in the decode
  routine, which has been completely rewritten. [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Vector translucency can be turned off with -notranslucency.
  [Valerio Verrando]


Source:
-------

- TMS34010 emulator. [Alex Pasadyn, Zsolt Vasvari]

- Replaced the 6502 emulator with a new one which also supports 65C02 and 6510.
  Marat Fayzullin's core is no longer used. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Fixed a bug in the 68000 BCD emulation which caused the F1 Dream timer to
  malfunction. [Nicola Salmoria]

- New function osd_on_screen_display() to show text over the game screen.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed bug in the Z80 block I/O instructions (INI, IND, INIR, INDR, OUTI,
  OUTD, OTIR, and OTDR). [Frank Palazzolo]

- Updated the FM emulation and the way the 8910 updates its buffers. FM also
  has support for YM2608 and YM2612, though they are not compiled in.
  [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- [DOS] Rearranged the makefile using archives to work around E2BIG error on
  some machines. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Support for CRC-32 checksums instead of MAME's custom ones. The actual CRCs
  will be added later to the drivers. [John Butler]

==========================================================================


0.34 BETA 1

IMPORTANT: now most games load the color PROMs from disk. You'll have to add
the missing files to the archives.
