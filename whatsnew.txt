Polygonet Commanders update: [Andrew Gardner]
 * Added more accurate host interface to dsp56k core
 * Removed a bunch of hacks in plygonet.c

Added new field Machine->basename which is used to describe the path
used for various file accesses. This is a helper for MESS, and should
not have any user-visible changes. The file accesses affected are:
configuration (cfg) files, snapshots, debugger comments, NVRAM,
and memory cards. [Aaron Giles]

Changed naming of screenshots. They are now created in separate
folders per game, with numeric names 0000.png, 0001.png, etc.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed artwork layout loading to load either gamename/gamename.lay
or gamename/default.lay. The latter is preferred, and allows for
easier reuse of layouts between games. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed max instruction bytes for 68020+ CPUs to avoid assertion in
new disassembler. [Aaron Giles]

Added flip screen offsets needed with new video parameters in the
pacman.c driver. [Aaron Giles]
