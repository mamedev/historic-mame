Source Changes
--------------
Major cleanup/rewrite of the Berzerk driver: [smf]
 * merged memory & io read/write maps.

 * hooked up nvram in frenzy memory map.
 * emulates magic ram shifter/flopper with 9 74LS153's as per the 
    schematics.
 * emulates magic ram alu with 2 74LS181's hardwired to logic mode as 
    per the schematics.

Updates for the ARM core: [Bryan McPhail]
 * Fixed software interrupts.
 * Fixed several mode change bugs.
 * Preliminary coprocessor support.

Deco fixes: [Bryan McPhail, Pierpaolo Prazzoli] 
 * Deco MLC video hardware near perfect for the most part, however no game 
    works properly because of an unemulated math coprocessor attached to

 * Deco 32: Night Slashers pretty much perfect apart from lack of sound.  
 * Deco 32: Some graphics fixes for Tattoo Assassins.
 * Deco 156: Heavy Smash pretty much perfect.
