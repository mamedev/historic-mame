Source Changes
--------------
Began converting drivers over to the new more accurate video timing
functions (video_screen_* functions instead of cpu_*). This first
batch includes all the games using the TMS34010 chip and the Atari 
games that use atarigen.c. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed Windows-isms in regrep.c. [couriersud, Aaron Giles]

Improvements to the kaneko driver. All the protection data should be 
correct now. [Sebastien Volpe]

Added DIP switch locations based on information from the manuals for
the following drivers: Karnov, Magmax, Omega Race, Spiders, Bagman,
and Bank Panic. [Justin Szczap]

Added a call winwindow_ui_exec_on_main_thread() to allow code on the 
window thread to cause a function to be executed on the main thread.
[Nathan Woods]

Fixed a crash when verifying samples when a sample has a NULL name.
[Nathan Woods]

Built the iButton data for keyboardmania 2nd mix and Pop'n Music 7.
With this update Pop'n Music will also show the self tests. 
[Ville Linde]

Properly fixed tile flipping in Mustache Boy. [David Haywood]

Built iButton data for ppd. [Ian Patterson]

Fixed the rest of the Atari games and the Cinematronics CCPU games to
use the newer video timing system. Also fixed reset problem in
Destroyer. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed sample audit to report all missing samples. [BUT]

Marked unknown dips for 005 according to manual. [Mike Ellery]

Updates drivers from C-E to use the newer video timing system.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed timer dipswitch in Alien Syndrome set 1. [Don Maeby]

Moved throttling, frameskipping, fast forwarding, and timing into the
core. Removed the equivalent code from the Windows OSD layer. This
now relies on options being set for controlling these features by the
OSD layer via options.c. Deprecated the old osd_get_fps_text()
function. Changed osd_update() to take a parameter indicating whether
or not the frame was skipped. Added new function osd_sleep() to the
OSD core timing library. [Aaron Giles]

Added a new mechanism for building in fonts. A new tool, png2bdc can
convert a specially formatted PNG file into a binary cached MAME font.
This cached font can be embedded into MAME. A new default small UI
font is now included, and built via this process to replace the old
hard-coded one. The new font is proportional, so there is better use
of limited screen real estate in small video modes. Some balancing/
tweaking of the actual font still needs to be done, and some basic
functionality still needs to be added to png2bdc. Consider this a
work-in-progress. [Aaron Giles]



New clones added
----------------
A Question of Sport (39-960-089) [Highwayman]
