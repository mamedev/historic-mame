Source Changes

[Brian Troha]

Improved DIP switches and documentation in the Championship Bowling
driver. [Brian Troha]

Major cleanup/rewrite of the NES PPU rendering code. [Brad Oliver]

Fixed protection in the world version of Virtua Bowling. [Brian Troha]

Added missing DIP switch to Hangman driver. [Wolfi]

Added a callback to the 68000 emulator for the TAS instruction,
which allows different implementations based on external hardware.
[David Haywood]

Namco System 22 update: [R. Belmont]

for games where the process of rendering has side effects such as
collision detection that need to always be present. [Aaron Giles]

correctly and without using unnecessary timers. [Aaron Giles]
