Source Changes
--------------
Changed how perodic timers are defined. Previously, you would specify a
number which was interpreted either as Hz (if less than 50000) or as
nanoseconds (if greater than 50000). Now, the time is specified as a period
and you use the standard TIME_IN_HZ or TIME_IN_NS macros. [Aaron Giles]

Turned on address error checking in the 68000 core. This slows things down a
bit but is more accurate and allows correct behavior of a couple of badly-
programmed games. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed several issues with address error checking in the 68000 core.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed 68000 bug that treated 8-bit branches with $FF offsets as illegal,
rather than allowing them and generating an address error. [Aaron Giles]

Created a new header file mamecore.h, which contains the core common useful
macros and typedefs that were scattered throughout the header files. Also
added endian swapping macros from MESS. [Aaron Giles]

Fully deprecated the use of cpu_setbank(), which was long ago replaced with
memory_set_bankptr(). [Aaron Giles]

Did some major cleanup on the MCR drivers [Aaron Giles]
- Implemented Super Sound I/O interrupts properly.
- Filled out all memory maps according to schematics.
- Fixed sound sync with various sound boards, allowing for kludges to be
  removed from Power Drive and Star Guards.
- Re-verified all connections from wiring diagrams.
- Documented various lamp and driver boards from the games.

Some makefile tweaks to hopefully catch variable declaration problems that
kept creeping into builds. Switched gcc compiler standard to gnu89.
[Atari Ace]

Removed usage of dirent.h APIs on Windows builds. [Atari Ace]

Corrected resolution to 256x256 in Stagger I, Red Hawk, Sen Jin - Guardian 
Storm. All other games still have old visible area that is correct for them.
[Mamesick]

Fixed crash in Volfied and Operation Wolf due to improper timer usage.
[Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed one of the TC360 sprite blending modes (used in Pulirula round 2 and 
Liquids Kids attract mode). [Bryan McPhail]

Fixed sprite/tilemap placement in Legend of Kage. [Phil Stroffolino]

PowerPC core update: [Nathan Woods]
- Added infrastructure to generate DSI and ISI exceptions
- Made the lbz/lbzu/lbzux/lbzx instructions properly clear out the 
  high 24 bits in the results
- Added SRR0 and SRR1 to the debug view

Did some cleanups in the vamphalf.c driver. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed speedbal again, after breaking it in the last update. 
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Changed Nitro Ball to use the new deco16_tilemap_34_combine_draw function 
Bryan added some time ago. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added a sprite wrap around needed in Riot level 2. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added sound to Dragon Bowl. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
