These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed Psychic 5 and Toki title screens. [Jarek Parchanski]

- Proper support of the playfield/sprite priority and palette system in Return
  of the Jedi. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Accurate colors in Spelunker II. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed Heiankyo Alien colors. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Fixed NeoGeo palette - it's 5 bits per gun, not 4. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added a kludge to avoid leftover sprites in Rally-X. [Larry Bank]

- Fixed missing background behind the three towers in Metal Slug level 1.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed missing line in the tank's shot in Metal Slug intro. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed the Swimmer side panel background color. [Gary Walton]

  Dragon Ninja and Sly Spy. [Bryan McPhail]

- Fixed the title screen in P.O.W. [Bryan McPhail]

- Fixed gaps in the start/finish line in Neo Drift Out. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Attempt at emulating some raster effects in the NeoGeo games. The IRQ2
  handling is still 99% unknown, however you can see the field in Super
  Sidekicks 3 and 4. This is largely unaccurate, and VERY slow. Hit F1 to
  toggle the emulation on or off (by default it's on). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Accurate colors in Galivan. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improved row scrolling in Street Fighter 2, plus several other fixes to the
  CPS1 games. [Paul Leaman]

- Fixed sprite colors in Euro League. [Nicola Salmoria]

  Salmoria]

- Fixed the green and white flags in Championship Sprint / Super Sprint, and
  maybe other Atari System 2 sprites as well. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed sprite flipping in Jack the Giant Killer end sequence. [Brad Oliver]

- Fixed (?) the title in Galaxian Part X. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed big sprites in Tokio, and unified it with Bubble Bobble.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- 16-bit color support in the NeoGeo driver. It's enabled in a few games which
  were particularly affected by reduction to 256 colors. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improved Star Fire. [Olivier Galibert]

- Kludged in a fix for char/sprite priority in Traverse USA. [Nicola Salmoria]

  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed the Galaxian-style starfield. Believe it or not, it had been broken
  since day 1. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Converted the System 16 drivers to use the TileMap system - they are now
  cleaner, faster, and support screen rotation. [Phil Stroffolino]

- Fixed colors in Birdie King 2. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Several fixes and improvements to D-Day. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Fixed foreground transparency in Pac-Land round 19. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Better backdrop for Battle Zone (bzone.png). [Nathan Sturm]

- Fixed sprite glitches in Jail Break and Iron Horse. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed the spider gfx, and sky color, in Rainbow Islands. [Mike Coates]

- Fixed background colors in Great Swordsman. [Jarek Parchanski]

- Fixed (hopefully) colors in Blue Print. [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Fixed shoot sound in Juno First. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added PCM samples to Ninja Kid II. [Jarek Parchanski]

- Completed sound support in TMNT. [Howie Cohen]

- Sound in Psycho-Nics Oscar. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added support for the 7751 sound chip in Monster Bash. Two samples are still
  needed (discrete circuits). [Mike Balfour]

- Good progress in sound emulation of the Exidy games (Venture, Pepper 2, etc.)
  [Dan Boris]

- Sound in Ghost Busters. [Bryan McPhail]

- uPD7759 support in Golden Axe, Shinobi, Passshtb, Alien Syndrome,
  Altered Beast. [Howie Cohen]

- Emulated speech in Sinistar. Samples are no longer used. [Alex Pasadyn]

- Sound fade timer ports in the CPS1 games (see Willow's Test mode for an
  example). [Paul Leaman]

- Samples support in Cosmic Guerilla. [Mike Coates]

- New sample support in Tac/Scan. [Jim Hernandez]

- Sound in Pac-Land. [Ernesto Corvi]

- Full sound in Sly Spy, Midnight Resistance, Dark Seal. [Bryan McPhail]

- Emulated the death sound in Mario Bros, the sample is no longer used.
  [Brian Stern]

- Implemented the RC filters in early Konami games (Time Pilot, Pooyan, etc.)
  [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Support for Eliminator 2/4 player samples and additional sounds for
  Zektor. [Jim Hernandez]

- Fixed tune in Phoenix. [Richard Davies]

- Added ADPCM samples to Mad Gear. [Bryan McPhail]

- Major improvements to Atari sound (e.g. speech in Toobin') [Aaron Giles]

- Sound in Rainbow Islands. [Mike Coates]

- Fixed sound in WBML. [Karl Stenerud]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Analog joystick support in Sinistar and Blaster. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Worked out the Super Punch Out protection. [Tatsuyuki Satoh, Ernesto Corvi]

- Hacked the protection in Super Sidekicks. [Battlepriest]

- Fixed two players games in Phoenix, and the protection in Pleiads (which
  made game resets not work). [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Emulated the protection in Seicross, Radical Radial, Frisky Tom.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed the protection in Frisky Tom. [Andrew Prime]

- The hang in Tapper should REALLY be fixed this time. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Emulated the protection in Knights of the Round and Carrier Air Wing.
  [Paul Leaman]

- Support for the ORIGINAL version of Bubble Bobble, with 68705 code from a
  pirate board. Wizards *do* throw stones in this version. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Removed the protection in Fatal Fury 2. [Eugenio De Renzi]

- Emulated the protection (TMS32010) in Twin Cobra, which is now fully
  playable. [Quench]

- Properly emulated the 68705 protection in The Electric Yo-Yo, Kram, Space
  Dungeon, Zoo Keeper. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Simulated the 8751 protection in F1 Dream. [Eric Hustvedt]

- Improved Birdie King 2 which is now playable. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Fixed speed in Oscar. [Bryan McPhail]

- Emulated the protection in Sly Spy. [Bryan McPhail]

- Fixed 1 player start button not working on level 31 of Tower of Druaga.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Emulated the protection in Jump Bug (Rock-ola). Some ROM splitup too, and
  fixed colors. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- "kbmame" multi-button key equivalents for the NeoGeo games. They are only
  available if cheats are enabled. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Emulated the protection in Hippodrome, which is now working 100%.
  [Byan McPhail]

- Drastically reduced load times of the larger NeoGeo games. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Rainbow Islands is playable (using the C-Chip dump from Jumping).
  [Mike Coates]

- Memory card support in the NeoGeo driver. Card data is saved to the MEMCARD
  directory (you have to create it). Use the TAB menu to access the memory card
  options. [Fabrice Martinez]

- Lots of improvements in the Atari drivers. [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed all known problems in Xain'd Sleena. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed decryption in Treasure Hunt [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Added dip switches to the Atari System 2 games. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added rotary control support to Top Gunner. This works in topgunbl *only* -
  the gun turret cannot be rotated in jackal and topgunr, those games don't
  support the rotary joystick. [Karl Stenerud]

- Incresed the horizontal resolution for NeoGeo to 320. This looks strange with
  some games, but it is definitely the correct value as I verified it on the
  real thing. Games like Puzzle Bobble and Baseball Stars use the extra area,
  while most of the other games draw just two bars in there. If a game looks
  odd, adjust your monitor to send the extra area offscreen. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed the slapstic emulation in Gauntlet, Gauntlet II, Xybots, Empire Strikes
  Back. Improved Rampart, but still not 100%. [Ernesto Corvi, Nicola Salmoria]

- Added scroll to Pinball Action when you push button 4, but I'm not sure it's
  correct. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed later levels in Arkanoid (US). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed controls in 720o. [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Support for the Namco System 1 sound system. [Ernesto Corvi]

- [DOS] Widened the frameskip range. It now is 0-11, meaning the number of
  frames to skip out of 12. For example, if the game normally runs at 60 fps,
  "-frameskip 2" will make it run at 50 fps, and "-frameskip 6" at 30 fps.
  Also, if a frame takes more than the allotted time to display, the lost
  time can be recovered in the following frames. Moreover, improved the way
  audio streams are handled, so they stay more in sync with the video. There
  should never be any more audio breakups EVER (as long as your system can
  keep the game running at 100% speed).
  All of these changes together mean that it is now possible to run at much
  higher frame rates than before (if your system is fast enough).
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] Implemented auto frameskip. It dynamically adjusts the frameskip
  setting to display the maximum possible frames without dropping below 100%
  speed.
  It is on by default; to turn it off, specify an explicit frameskip value,
  e.g. "-frameskip 0". Autoframeskip only works well if your machine is fast
  enough to run the game at 100% speed. If it isn't, you had better use a
  fixed frameskip.
  NOTE: you must delete mame.cfg (or manually change the line "frameskip = 0"
  to "frameskip = auto") for the auto frameskip to become the default.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] "vmame" modes 320x480 and 400x600, which speed up scanlined VESA modes
  for some games and graphic cards which support these resolutions.
  Currently, these modes will not be autodetected, that is, the commandline
  options "-320x480" or "-400x600" have to be used.
  [Nicola Salmoria, Michael Cunanan]

- [DOS] Joysticks are now selected by a symbolic name (e.g. "-joystick wingex"
  for Wingman Extreme) instead of a number. For the list of names, look into
  readme.txt. Numbers are still supported, but may not be in future releases.
  SNES gamepads on parallel ports are supported now, provided you have some
  additional hardware (the "official" Snespad-Support site is
  http://snespad.emulationworld.com). [Bernd Wiebelt]

- [DOS] For cosmetical reasons, added support for VESA3, which can be selected
  by putting "vesamode=vesa3" into mame.cfg. It is highly unlikely that you'll
  get any speed improvement. [Bernd Wiebelt]

- [DOS] The key to change frameskip is now F9 instead of F8. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improved palette compression with color fades. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improved the YM2610 emulation. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- [DOS] Added a header to .inp files (same as MAME32). With the additional
  header, the user no longer needs to specify the game name when playing back
  .inp recordings. [Mike Haaland]

- Added the ability to show the total number of colors on screen. This is
  useful during development to know if a game can be shrinked to 256 colors or
  it requires a 16-bit display. Press CTRL+F11 to toggle the display. This is
  only available in debug builds. [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] New option -volume n to set the startup volume. The volume is an
  attenuation in dB, e. g. "-volume -12" will start with a -12dB attenuation.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- The user interface is rotated by -rol and -ror. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improvements to the YM2610 timers, added an interface for external volume
  control. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Major changes to the whole CPU interface and cores. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- new switch "-waitvsync /-nowaitvsync" (use it with -novsync); it waits for
  video sync before drawing the screen but uses the normal MAME throttling.
  This gives smoother display with scrolling game (like vsync), but works
  with video modes with higher refresh frequency, and is more win-friendly.
  [Valerio Verrando]

- Added a "Game History" entry to the menu. Data is fetched from the file
  HISTORY.DAT. Thanks to Brian Deuel, Neil Bradley and the Retrocade dev team
  for allowing us to use Retrocade's game history database. [John Butler]

- All new, completely rewritten debugger. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- [DOS] Switches -noartwork and -nosamples to turn off artwork or sample
  loading. [Valerio Verrando]

- [DOS] New tweaked 256x256 VGA modes (both scanlines and noscanlines)
  stretched to fill the screen. They are automatically used for horizontal
  games, and are preferable to the -stretch option since they are faster.
  You might have to adjust your monitor settings to make them properly
  centered and fill the screen (use the border displayed on startup as a
  guideline). [Valerio Verrando]

- Added menu option to configure the default joystick settings (like the
  default keys), [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] Fixed severe slowdowns when 16-bit audio was selected.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] The parameters which control tweaked VGA modes can be changed by
  editing mame.cfg, so they can be fine tuned to match each particular video
  card/monitor combination (these are non standard modes so they can't be made
  to work in the same way on all setups). If you want to try that (warning:
  only experienced users should try) make sure to read vgatweak.txt.
  [Valerio Verrando]

- Added support for .wav samples. The custom .sam samples are no longer
  supported (you can use the sam2wav converter to convert them). [Aaron Giles]

- [DOS] Rough triple buffering support in VESA modes. You can turn it on with
  the -triplebuffer switch. It is not guaranteed to work well, but if it does,
  it offers results similar to -waitvsync but without the performance drop.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- A missing ROM for which no good dump is known to exist is no longer a fatal
  error - you can start the emulation even if the file is missing. Its space
  will be filled with random data. Of course the game will probably
  malfunction. The output of -verifyroms is slightly changed, it says "NO GOOD
  DUMP KNOWN" now and doesn't print 00000000 checksums. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improved VLM5030 emulation. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Fixed a couple of bugs in the 68000 emulation (both asm and C). They affected
  Power Spikes 2 and F1 Dream. [Mike Coates]

- Improved uPD7759 ADPCM decode. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Moved mixer control out of streams.c and into the new mixer.c. Now the On
  Screen Display can be used to change the volume of any channel, not just ones
  handled by streams.c. The configuration is also saved on exit and is
  automatically reloaded the next time you start the game. [Nicola Salmoria]

- The Pause key can be changed from the "Keys (defaults)" configuration menu.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added a palette viewer to the gfx viewer (F4). [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] New video modes from CabMAME: low scanrate modes for connection to
  NTSC/PAL and arcade monitors. -monitor NNNN selects the monitor type:
  "standard" (default), "ntsc", "pal", "arcade". -centerx N and -centery N
  each take a signed value (-8 to 8 for centerx, -16 to 16 for centery) and let
  you shift the low scanrate modes around. -waitinterlace forces update of
  both odd and even fields of an interlaced display for each game loop.
  [Brian Lewis]

- [DOS] Since there are now many tweaked VGA modes which may have compatibility
  problems with some video cards / monitors, they are now off by default. By
  default, VESA is used; the -vesa command line switch is no longer used.
  Instead, there is a -tweak switch which enables the VGA tweaked modes.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] New tweaked VGA modes: 384x240 (for CPS1, Pang etc.), 384x256 (for Lode
  Runner etc.), 336x240 (for Gauntlet and other Atari games), 320x240 (for
  NeoGeo and others). They are used automatically, if your video card/monitor
  can't handle them, use -notweak (or try adjusting the parameters in mame.cfg
  if you know what you are doing). [Brian Lewis, Andrea Mazzoleni]

- [DOS] Removed the -nodouble command line option. Use -nostretch instead. If
  you are updating from an earlier beta, make sure to delete mame.cfg (or
  manually update it) otherwise stretch will be disabled. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Changed the analog port handling to avoid problems with keyboard control
  (e.g. Arkanoid 2). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Simplified the error message when ROMs are missing. It now gives a list of
  all the missing ROMs, it doesn't stop at the first one. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- New function cpu_getcurrentframe() which returns the number of the video
  frame currently being played. It can be used by drivers to control effects
  which spawn over multiple frames (e.g. blinking) without using static
  internal counter (which would require a custom interrupt handler to avoid
  problems when the game is paused). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Frame skipping is entirely handled by the OS dependant code.
  osd_skip_this_frame() no longer has the "recommend" parameter.
  Also, replaced osd_update_display() and osd_update_audio() with the single
  osd_update_video_and_audio().
  IMPORTANT: osd_update_video_and_audio() is called *every frame* by the main
  core. It's its responsability to know whether the frame has to be skipped.
  osd_skip_this_frame() is used by the main core only to know if it can avoid
  calling drv->vh_update(). [Nicola Salmoria]

- New Z80 emulator. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Fixed several bugs in the I86 emulator. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- New CPU interrupt system. The functions cpu_set_irq_line() and
  cpu_set_nmi_line() can be used to precisely control the status of the CPU
  physical lines, instead of using the limited control granted by
  cpu_cause_interrupt(). [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Konami 007232 sound chip emulator. This is used by TMNT. [Hiromitsu Shioya]

- The driver input ports are now 16 bit. This allows for higher resolution
  analog inputs (Arkanoid 2). Also, the 68000 based games no longer have to
  read and mix two 8 bit ports to get a 16 bit value. [Brad Oliver]

- Added a horrible dirty hack to allow opcode encryption on CPUs other than
  the main one. It's really ugly and needs a rewrite, but it's enough to get
  sound in Pocket Gal and The Real Ghostbusters. [Nicola Salmoria]

- New 68000 C core. [Karl Stenerud]

- Fixed some bugs in the I8039 emulation. [Brian Stern]

- Z8000 emulator. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- NEC uPD7759 emulation. This is used by TMNT, System 16, and others.
  [Juergen Buchmueller, Mike Balfour, Howie Cohen]

- CVSD emulation, used for speech in Sinistar and in the 34010 games (Smash TV
  etc.). [Larry Bank, Alex Pasadyn]

- A couple of bug fixes in the 6808 core. [Brad Oliver]

- TMS32010 emulator. This is used by Twin Cobra. [Quench]

- New TileMap code. This makes the driver code cleaner and gives some
  performance boost in the video rendering. [Phil Stroffolino]

- [DOS] Now compiled using Allegro 3.11.

- Merged the old and new Namco sound subssytem, and added support for stereo
  output. [Aaron Giles]

- H6280 emulator, used by several DECO games. [Bryan McPhail]

- Redesigned the struct InputPort to use less space, and changed how analog
  inputs are defined. An additional benefit is that the keys for digital
  emulation of analog inputs are now defined in the Keys for this Game menu,
  together with all other keys, instead that in the Analog Controls menu.
  The Analog Controls menu remains to set the other parameters.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added default strings for dip switches. For example, instead of "Cabinet",
  use DEF_STR( Cabinet ). The constants are defined in inptport.h.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added support for up to 4 analog controllers (multiple trackballs are NOT
  supported under DOS, but multiple joysticks should work). [Brad Oliver]

- Major overhaul to the Atari games, and fixes to the 68000 and 6502 cores to
  get them going properly. [Aaron Giles]

- OSD_FILETYPE_MEMCARD for memory cards. [Fabrice Martinez]

- The zlib library is required to build MAME, it can be downloaded from
  http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/.

- PNG save support. save_screen_snapshot() may be called by osd_save_snapshot()
  to save a standardized shot. Under DOS, .png files go to the SNAP
  directory. [Mathis Rosenhauer, Mike Haaland]

- struct GameSample no longer has a volume field (since it is not stored in .wav
  files), to replace that struct Samplesinterface has an additional volume field
  which affects all samples played. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Replaced osd_adjust_sample() with osd_set_sample_freq() and
  osd_set_sample_volume(), and the OSD_PAN_xxx macros with MIXER_PAN_xxx.

- Added support for slave mode to the MSM5205 emulation. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- IMPORTANT FOR PORTERS: the "safety area" allocated by osd_new_bitmap() must
  now be 16 pixels instead of 8. This is required by the NeoGeo driver.

- Added OSD_KEY_PRTSCR, OSD_KEY_LWIN, OSD_KEY_RWIN, OSD_KEY_MENU. Also moved
  OSD_KEY_RCONTROL, OSD_KEY_ALTGR, OSD_KEY_PAUSE.
