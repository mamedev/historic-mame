0.93
----

The main feature of this release is Aaron's huge update to the sound system.
There is a high chance this has introduced new sound / crashing bugs in
several drivers. A number of problems were already found and fixed prior to
the 0.93 release thanks to Aaron, Derrick and R.Belmont.  Updates will follow
to correct any severe bugs found.  Please test this release extensively.

Sound System update [Aaron Giles]
 (see list below for changes)

Sound System Changes
--------------------

Core changes
-----------
common.c:
* Changed auto_malloc() behavior so that a failure is absolute (calls 
osd_die); you can now assume that auto_malloc will always succeed and will 
never return NULL.
* Removed all sample loading code; this is now in sound/samples.c

config.c:
* Tried to update this to the new mixer stuff in usrintrf.c, but it hasn't 
been tested and I bet it's busted somehow.

driver.h:
* driver->sound_attributes is gone; if you need to detect stereo support, 
count the speakers.

mame.h:
* Machine->samples is history (yay!)

timer.c:
* I created a new type of timer that has a pointer for a callback param 
instead of an int. These sit next to the existing timer code, so nothing 
else is affected. They made object orienting the sound cores much much 
cleaner.

usrintrf.c:
* Mixing volumes are retrived from the sound core, not from the mixer (which 
is gone). Mixing volumes can now be overdriven to 2.0 (could be increased in 
the future)


Machine driver changes
----------------------
* MDRV_SPEAKER_ADD is how to create a new speaker. You specify a name and a 
3D vector for where the speaker is relative to the player's head.
* MDRV_SPEAKER_REMOVE and MDRV_SPEAKER_REPLACE operate as expected.
* MDRV_SPEAKER_STANDARD_MONO("name") specifies a single standard mono 
speaker positioned directly in front of the user.
* MDRV_SPEAKER_STANDARD_STEREO("leftname","rightname") specifies a standard 
pair of stereo speakers situated to the left/right of the user.

* MDRV_SOUND_ADD now takes a 'clock' parameter instead of an interface 
pointer. The clock for each chip is specified here rather than in the 
interface. I have removed any 'clock'-like parameters from all the sound 
interface structures.
* MDRV_SOUND_CONFIG is where you specify the interface. This mirrors 
MDRV_CPU_CONFIG. Note that you do not have to specify a config; in this 
case, it is NULL. This is ok. Many sound chips really only need a clock and 
volume info (which has also been removed from the interface structs).
* MDRV_SOUND_ROUTE is how to control where a sound chip outputs its data. 
The first parameter is the output index, or ALL_OUTPUTS if you want to route 
all the outputs for a given chip to the same place. The second parameter is 
either the name of a speaker or the name of another tagged sound chip. The 
third parameter is a floating point gain: 1.0 is standard.
* You can specify as many sound routes as you need; multiple routes for the 
same output will split the sound. For example, you can route the single mono 
output of an OKIM6295 to both the left and right speakers on a stereo 
system.


Sound core interface changes
----------------------------
mixer.c/.h:
* These files are gone, gone, gone. Everything is handled by the streams or 
by sndintrf.c directly. Mixing is performed by code in sndintrf.c which 
creates a stream to do the final mixing.

sndintrf.h:
* We now no longer #include every sound core's header. You have to include 
them yourself in your driver.

sndintrf.c:
* Sound cores are now hooked up very much like CPU cores. There is a single 
get_info function that is public for each core; all other functions and data 
are retrieved through it.
* Similar to CPU cores, you can call sndtype_xxx() to query/set values for a 
specific sound chip type; you can also call sndnum_xxx() to query/set values 
for an indexed sound chip in the Machine->drv->sound array; finally, you can 
call sndti_xxx() to query/set values for the nth instance of any give sound 
chip type (sndti = sound type+index).
* At startup, all sound cores/filters are created. Then all the speakers are 
created. Finally, everything is wired up together. There are new consistency 
checks to make sure you don't do anything wildly bad.
* sndintrf.c calls the OSD layer now, and always requests stereo output. It 
also does a final downmix from the various speaker streams into left/right 
streams based on the X coordinate of the speaker.

sound/streams.c:
* I have added a new type defined in sound/streams.h: stream_sample_t, which 
is used to represent a sample as used by the stream system. It is typedef'd 
to an INT32.
* Regardless of the size of stream_sample_t, all streams should be generated 
as if 16 bits were the maximum. The extra bits give us headroom to overdrive 
things if we want.
* All streams have the same format callback, with support for multiple 
inputs and outputs.
* Each stream has a sample rate; inputs to that stream will be 
down/upsampled to that rate; outputs will be down/upsampled as necessary to 
connect to the input of the next stream/speaker in line.
* Each input to a stream has its own gain, and each output has a gain as 
well. These can be controlled while things are running to provide some extra 
volume knobs.
* I haven't done much in the way of optimizations in order to keep things 
simple and working. Once things are back to normal, I may consider some 
additional optimizations.


Notes for sound core authors
----------------------------
* I marked all sound cores as Copyright the MAME Team; if you want your own 
credit there, feel free to send an update.
* I removed all volume and clock speeds from the interfaces; these are 
specified elsewhere now.
* I made interfaces optional for many sound chips that often don't need an 
interface.
* Many sound cores used global variables and assumed a single instance of 
themselves; this has been fixed in all cases.
* In some cases I removed global lookup tables and pushed them into the 
sound interfaces. This can eventually be fixed but I didn't want to deal 
with it.
* stream_init and stream_init_multi are gone; there is only stream_create 
now.
* Streams are named for you automatically, so you don't need to pass in 
names to stream_create. Volumes are also outside of your control now, so you 
don't need to pass in volumes to stream_create either.
* The get_info function can return pointers to set_info(), start(), stop(), 
and reset(). There is no concept of an update() function anymore -- updates 
are handled via streams.
* The start() function is passed three things: a 'sound index', which 
indicates which instance of chip you are (i.e., 0 if you're the first chip 
of this type to be created, 1 if you're the second, etc); a 'clock' which is 
specified in the driver (no clocks in the interfaces please!); and a 
'config' which is a pointer to the interface for this chip (it can be NULL 
too, be careful).
* The start() function now is expected to allocate memory for its data 
structures and return a pointer to that if successful. If not, it should 
return NULL.
* The pointer returned by the start() function is passed to the stop() and 
reset() functions.
* Since there were many cases where we provided a read/write handler for the 
'nth' chip, you can also fetch the pointer from the start() function by 
calling sndti_token(chip_type, index).
* If you have a non-digital chip that doesn't do internal clipping, you can 
probably remove the clipping code and let the mixer clip it in the end.
* If you do your mixing in a secondary buffer to get more bits of 
resolution, you can probably optimize your code to mix directly into the 
stream buffer.
* While fixing up all the sound cores I was VERY brute force in getting 
things to work. If you don't like what I did to your sound core, feel free 
to fix it up.


Sound core-specific changes
---------------------------
* ADPCM -- I removed this entirely and wired up dummy MSM5205s to most of 
the drivers still using it; these need to be revisited and fixed.
* AY8910 -- cleaned up the interface for the YM chips to access this.
* Custom -- many drivers using "custom" drivers were just using hard-coded 
samples and playing them with the (now-defunct) mixer. This is not "custom", 
it is "samples". They have been converted over to samples.
* Filter (volume) -- this is a new very simple filter that can be used to 
control the volume of a stream if you need an extra knob.
* Filter (RC) -- this is a new filter that replaces the old RC filter that 
was in the streams code. Eventually, this could get replaced by some simple 
discrete logic.
* IremGA20 -- Acho cod... transmission lost
* NES APU -- changed the way this worked so that it used streams properly 
instead of an update function.
* Samples -- there is now a start function that allows you to create your 
own custom samples if you want. This allows us to replace "custom" drivers 
with "samples" in several cases. There is a new call sample_start_raw() 
which lets you play a raw sample from a pointer to INT16 data.
* Votrax -- there was a dead Vortrax core that was still being 
hard-compiled. I pulled this out and made it a proper sound type (which 
currently isn't included).
* VRender0 -- fixed a clipping bug that was lurking there (negative clipping 
wrapped to positive values -- noticeable at 32-bits)
* YM2151 -- removed the alternate version and kept only Jarek's around. 
Having two cores was confusing and caused problems.
* YM2203/2608/2610 -- these chips now pass a set of functions into the FM 
core with pointers to all the AY8910-compatibility routines, rather than 
relying on global pointers.
* YMZ280B -- this code is just terrible now compared to when I first wrote 
it! :(
