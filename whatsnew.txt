MAMETesters Bugs Fixed

Source Changes
--------------
Integrated 53C810 into the SCSI framework. [Tomas Karlsson]

Balanced the sound in Final Tetris, Boogie Wings, B.C. Story, Metal Saver.
[sonikos]

Fixed Q*Bert knocker connection. [Kevin Jonas]

Some improvements to M37710, C352 and NamcoNA sound. [cync]

Corrected CPS1 frequencies based on measurements from a real PCB.
[Philip Bennett]

Significant change to the memory system. RAM areas are now no longer 
allocated out of the memory_region for a given CPU. This means that drivers
which assume that RAM is located at some offset to the base of the memory
region will be broken. [Aaron Giles]

Added save state information for streams so that dynamic volume changes
get properly restored. Unfortunately this breaks all existing save states.
[Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the HC55516 sound chip. Added save state support
to the Williams sound boards. Added save state support to games in the
mcr3.c and mcr68.c drivers, marking them as GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE. [Aaron Giles]

Changed timer_alloc_ptr-style timers so that the pointer parameter is
supplied at allocation time and is not changeable. This makes these timers
more easily supported in save states. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed missing save state registrations in the m6809 CPU core. [Aaron Giles]

Deferred state loading until all anonymous timers have cleared. This fixes
issues where the timers would fire after the load and would clobber data 
that was just loaded. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up and fully mapped the Williams sound boards. Also added save state
support to them. [Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the classic Williams drivers, marking them as
GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE. [Aaron Giles]
