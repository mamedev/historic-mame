* fixed P3/P4 controls in Rim Rockin' Basketball

* redid Slick Shot input to use a crosshair for starting point and trackball 
movement for velocity
* hooked up inputs for Dyno Bop/Super Strike Bowling, which are now somewhat 
playable
* rewrote blitter implementation to be much simpler (no more macros)
* measured and implemented accurate blitter timing (fixes some speed 
problems)
* cleaned up TMS34061 implementation to remove dirty pixel tracking
* fixed scanline computations in TMS34061 code
* updated Capcom Bowling driver as well to handle TMS34061 changes

Sega ST-V update [Angelo Salese]
* Fixed Batman Forever rom loading,now the game works,thanks to Runik to point this out.
* Fixed some interrupt issues because the old implementation was giving several hangs
  on the above game.To be more specific added the sprite draw end irq to the INTERRUPT_GEN
  structure & fixed a bug which prevented the vblank bit to not be cleared if the irq mask
  has the VBLANK-IN disactivated.
* Fixed the NMI_disable/enable cmds on the SMPC device,his function is to active/disactive
  a bit in the SMPC ram.This fixes the "2 credits bug at start-up" in Shanghai Triple Threat.
* Fixed a bug in the bitmap type 4 in VDP2 handling,which was causing the Sunsoft logo in
  Shanghai Triple Threat to not show correctly.
