MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
metmqstr0105yel [Aaron Giles]



Source Changes
--------------
Cleaned up the usage of includes/*.h files across the project, by
ensuring that:
 1. All includes/foo.h files are annotated with comments describing 
     the source of the declarations.
 2. Each source file so annotated also explicitly does an
     #include "includes/foo.h" to ensure consistent definitions.
Along the way a number of inconsistent, irrelevant, and incomplete
declarations were removed/cleaned up. [Atari Ace]

Moved calls to ui_set_visible_area() into set_visible_area() to work
around timing problems when they are called at separate times during
a single frame. [Nathan Woods]

Updated CPS driver to more accurately draw tilemaps, based on
evidence from a board with mixed ROMs. [David Haywood]

Fixed crash bug in old debugger introduced in the last release.
[Olivier Galibert]

Added demo sounds DIP switch to Pig Newton. [Derrick Renaud]

Fixed DIP switches in gunmast, batlbubl. [Brian Troha]

Added simulated sound for tumbleb2 and pangpang. [David Haywood]

Added accessors for the CA2, CB2 and IRQ signals on the 6821 PIA.
[Nathan Woods]

Accurate C-Chip emulation in Bonze Adventure to fix protection 
problems (no more missing or made up data, all data extracted from 
working pcb). [Bryan McPhail]

Some cleanups to the Taito F3 naming. [Marco, Bryan McPhail]

Fixed the Z80 PIO code to prevent an interrupt to occur between the 
PIO_OP_MODE byte and mask which follows. According to the datasheet, 
this is not permitted in hardware. [Robert]

Added many FPU opcodes to the M68040 core. [Ville Linde]

Fixed rom loading in all Taito JC games. [Ville Linde]

Added TMS320C51 cpu core. [Ville Linde]

Split out some of the Nintendo 64 core pieces into MESS-shareable
modules. [R. Belmont]

Removed hard linkage of game driver clones. This reduces hard 
inter-driver dependencies and allows for easier usage of tiny.mak.
[Atari Ace, Aaron Giles]

Updates to the PGM driver: [El Semi]
 - Corrected mask on sprite width parameter in sprite list
 - Corrected decryption function for The Killing Blade
 - Fixed GFX Rom loading in The Killing Blade
 - Added set The Killing Blade (Taiwan?)
 - Added some WIP protection simulation for The Killing Blade
    (Taiwan?), game boots but at least one stage is broken

Added $(OBJ)/%.s target to the makefile for easy disassembly
analysis of generated code (you can also use the $(OBJ)/%.pp to
examine preprocessor output). [Nathan Woods]

Moved region and address space names out of the Windows-specific
code and into more common locations. [Olivier Galibert]

Fixed a bug with code comments that led to incorrect display for
long comments. [Andrew Gardner]

Added several missing H8 opcodes to the core and color DAC to 
lastfght.c. [Tomasz Slanina]

Changed -romident option so that it returns errorlevels based on how
many ROMs were identified (0=all files identified, 1=all files except
some non-ROM files identified, 2=some files identified, 3=no files
identified). [Aaron Giles]

Added stricter type checking for save state registrations (only works 
in gcc). [Aaron Giles]

Changed automatic ROM assignment logic in the memory system so that
it doesn't auto-assign out-of-bounds ROM regions. [Aaron Giles]

Changed memory save state registration so it doesn't register for
saving memory areas that overlap memory regions. This means that 
drivers which rely on extra memory regions for RAM will need to fix
that before supporting save. [Aaron Giles]

Modified a number of drivers that were using empty RAM regions for
RAM or which had extraneous memory regions. Most significant changes
were to the arcadia, nss, and stv drivers. [Aaron Giles]

Added a warning during validity checks to point out empty memory
regions. These should either be eliminated, or marked with an 
explicit fill value (ROMREGION_ERASE00 or ROMREGION_ERASEFF) to clear
the warnings. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote a large chunk of the Amiga emulation to support sound and
additional video modes/effects including extra half-bright mode, 
manual sprites, and mid-scanline changes. This is still a work
in progress. [Aaron Giles]
