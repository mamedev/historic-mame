- Various fixes to System 16 games. [Andrew Prime]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Further improved the YM3812 emulator, especially the rhythm section (check
  Snow Bros!). [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- [DOS] -noym3812opl is now the default (this won't have effect unless you
  delete mame.cfg). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed a bug in the T-11 emulation which caused APB not to work and the end
  of race results in Super Sprint to contain garbage. [Aaron Giles]


Source:
-------

- Rewritten the OS dependant joystick interface, it's like the keyboard
  interface now. Also a few function renames, and osd_wait_keypress() must
  now return a keycode. [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] The above should remove all limitations on number of axis and buttons,
  so e.g. joypads with multiple sticks should work. Changes to the analog
  devices handling will follow. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Konami 052001/053248 CPU emulation, used by many games. [Ernesto Corvi,
  Manuel Abadia]

- Konami 053260 sound chip emulation. [Ernesto Corvi]

- Sega PCM and RFC68 sound emulators, used by System 16. [Hiromitsu Shioya]

- Moved the profiler into the core. The OS dependant code need only provide a
  osd_cycles() inline function/macro in osinline.h, returning a counter. The
  function must be as low overhead as possible since it is called thousands
  of times per second when the profiler is active. The counter should be as
  precise as possible, to provide accurate measurements; the ideal unit is the
  number of CPU cycles, e.g. as returned by the Pentium instruction RDTSC.
  The profiler display is handled by the core, so the OS code only has to make
  the usual profiler_mark() calls to profile different sections of the code
  (PROFILER_BLIT, PROFILER_SOUND and so on).
  Note: to avoid conflicts, the OS code must do the check for the "show fps"
  key this way, otherwise input will be lost:
	if (!keyboard_pressed(KEYCODE_LSHIFT) && !keyboard_pressed(KEYCODE_RSHIFT)
		&& !keyboard_pressed(KEYCODE_LCONTROL) && !keyboard_pressed(KEYCODE_RCONTROL)
		&& input_ui_pressed(IPT_UI_SHOW_FPS))
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] The -profiler switch is no longer needed to enable the profiler, it is
  automatically turned on and off when you hit Shift+F11. [Nicola Salmoria]

  than the old one. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- [DOS] Triple buffer support in tweaked VGA modes. Warning: this is slower

- [DOS] If you are using a HotRod, use the -hotrod switch to adjust the default

Source:
-------

- [DOS] Compiled with Allegro WIP 3.9.23. IMPORTANT: there is a bug in
  Allegro's new keyboard hangling, which will prevent numeric pad keys from
  working properly when used together with ctrl and alt. Until it is fixed in
  the main Allegro distribution, you will have to replace the source file
  allegro\src\misc\pckeys.c with the provided one, and recompile Allegro.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] The new Allegro provides support for PSX and N64 pads (info here:
  http://www.debaser.force9.co.uk/ccmame), and for the Wingman Warrior.
  The names for the -joy parameter are
  psxlpt1
  psxlpt2
  psxlpt3
  n64lpt1
  n64lpt2
  n64lpt3
  wingwarrior
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Rewritten the OS dependant keyboard interface. A rewrite of the koystick
  interface will follow. The OS dependant code now only has to provide four
  functions:
  osd_get_key_list()
  osd_is_key_pressed()
  osd_customize_inputport_defaults() [optional]
  osd_wait_keypress() [optional]
  everything else is handled by the main core.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- New sprite manager, used in System 16, Ninja Gaiden, Shoot Out, Blood Bros.
  [Phil Stroffolino]

- Took the gfx drawing functions out of common.c into the new dragfx.c.
  In preparation for further changes to the data structures, abstracted the
  low level data copying and used macros to generate 8-bit and 16-bit
  versions. [Nicola Salmoria]
