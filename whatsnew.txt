NOTE: If you are experiencing sound stuttering due to not being able
to run your display at >60Hz, please give the -speed option a try.
You should be able to run MAME at a small emulation speed decrease
in order to get the game under your monitor's refresh rate.

Source Changes
--------------
Fixed recently introduced regression in nemesis driver. [Atari Ace]

Improved fixes to the chdman CD creating code. [smf]

Updated amspdwy.c driver to fix the DIP Switches for 'amspdwy' which 
are slightly different than the ones for 'amspdwya' which were 
correct. [stephh]

Fixed HP Saturn CPU core disassembler. [Wilbert Pol]

Fixed clock speed and colors in Trivia Genius. [Lord Nightmare]

Cleaned up Taito drivers to use common defines for common input 
ports across drivers. [stephh]

Removed redundant hard-coded definitions for Pole Position pedals.
[Alex Jackson]

Improved DIP switches for bombjack. [stephh]

Changed default layouts in BFM games to hide VFD by default since it
is not visible. [James Wallace]

Further improvements to the TMS5220 emulation and more unification
with the TMS5110 core. [Lord Nightmare]

Changed INI parsing to look for source file INIs in <inipath>/source
first. This is to disambiguate INIs where the game name matches the
source filename. If the INI file is not found in <inipath>/source,
then it is looked for in the <inipath> as before. [Aaron Giles]

Merged Raiden memory maps. Cleaned up the COP emulation code in 
Raiden 2. [Aaron Giles]

Added new experimental control for overall emulation speed. This
lets you specify how fast/slow the gameplay should happen relative to
the original. -speed 1.0 means run at normal speed. -speed 2.0 means
run at 2x speed. -speed 0.5 means run at half speed. Note that the
sound pitch is shifted as a result. If you are running early Namco
games that normally run at 60.60Hz, you can run them at -speed 0.99
and it should run at under 60Hz, which should prevent sound stuttering
if your monitor is not capable of greater than 60Hz refresh rates.
If this turns out to be useful, future versions may support a 
-speed refresh parameter that automatically tweaks the speed to keep
you under your monitor's refresh rate. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed disassembly of V30 bit instructions. [Aaron Giles]

Source Changes
--------------
Fixed behavior of auto_realloc() so that it always reallocs from its
original pool. [Atari Ace]

Fixed divide-by-zero when running with -video none in some cases.
[Atari Ace]

ARM7 core fixes: [R. Belmont, Ryan Holtz]
 - Fixed behavior when R15 is the source of a MOV
 - Fixed flags calc for ADC/SBC
 - Fixed flags calc for NEG
 - Fixed flags calc for CMP
 - Fixed time running backwards on Thumb instructions
 - Fixed some ARM instructions doing indiscriminate change_pc()s

Fixed converting CD's containing audio that were ripped by cdrdao, 
which was broken recently. The code is cleaner and more maintainable 
now. [smf]

Fixed chdman_open() "w" to always create/truncate the file, leaving 
"r+" to try opening first and then truncating. This matches behavior
in the core. [smf]

Added missing port 3/4 to M6803 cpu core. [Curt Coder]

Changed 6850ACIA to use MSB/LSB read handlers. [Curt Coder]

Fixed two minor bugs in the COP400 CPU disassembler. Hooked up the 
internal 64 bytes of DATA RAM to the core. [Andrew Gardner]

Added support in the debugger for reading/writing memory without
translation. [Olivier Galibert]

MSM6242 updates: [Ernesto Corvi]
 - Added support for 12/24 hour mode
 - Added support for the HOLD bit
 
Galaxian driver updates: [stephh]
 - fixed 'spcdraga' GFX ROMS loading
 - 100% verified Dip Switches for all sets
 - added long notes for all sets
 
Significantly revamped the tilemap rendering code. There are now only
two tilemap types, based on whether or not you want transparency
based on pen or color. All existing tilemap effects are built on top
of these two modes. The internal tilemap handling code has been
reorganized and simplified in a number of cases. For most games, this
change is transparent (har har), apart from the change in tilemap
type values. Several concepts within the tilemap system now have
different terminology for clarity and to remove some ambiguous naming
('priority', for example, was overloaded). A small tutorial and better
documentation is now present at the top of tilemap.h and provides
more details of the changes. [Aaron Giles]
