[note: only important changes are listed]

Program:
- Support for:
  Scramble (wrong colors, no sound)
  Uniwars (US version of Japanese Irem game)
  Frogger (including bootleg version running on a Scramble board)
    (wrong colors, no sound)
  Amidar (wrong colors, no sound)
  Turtles (wrong colors, no sound)
  Rally X (wrong colors, no sound, slowdowns)

- I'm beginning to understand how the Wizard of Wor video hardware works,
  gameplay hasn't changed but the graphics are more faithfully reproduced.

- Star background in Galaxians & co. The way I calculate it is probably not
  correct, anyway it looks reasonable.

- Fixed staccato notes in Pacman and other games using the same hardware.
  There are still some minor glitches (especially in Ms. Pac Man) but Pac Man
  tunes are now very close to the original.

Source:
- I reorganized the source directory tree, instead of one directory for every
  game there are now four directories (drivers, machine, vidhrdw, sndhrdw)
  which contain files named after the game.


0.5
---

Program:
- Fixed some problems in the Wizard of Wor driver, but it is still far from
  complete.

- Support for:
  Donkey Kong Jr. (wrong colors, no sound)
  Galaxians and the plethora of clones (correct colors, limited sound)
  Pisces (correct colors, limited sound)
  "Japanese Irem game". I believe the colors are correct, but since I've
    never seen the original game I can't know for sure.
  War of the Bugs (wrong colors, limited sound)
  Moon Cresta (wrong colors, limited sound)
  The End (wrong colors, no sound)

- By popular demand, reverted to the old AY-3-8910 emulation code.

Source:
- Changed readroms() to allow scatter loading of a single ROM. This was needed
  for Donkey Kong Jr. Now the end of the RomModule array is marked by a size==0,
  while name==0 means "continue loading the previous ROM at this address".

- Some bug fixes and changes to reduce porting problems (thanks to Brad Oliver)

- New function copybitmap() in common.c. Limited for now, will change in the
  future.


0.4
---

Program:
- Bagman support (wrong colors)

- Early Wizard of Wor support (not playable).

- New experimental AY-3-8910 sound emulation code provided by Andy Milne
  (andy@canetics.com). This sounds better in some places and worse in others.
  It is used by Crazy Climber, Crazy Kong and Bagman. Let me know what you
  think.

Source:
- Optimizations in drawgfx(), Mr. Do!'s title screen and intermissions now
  run faster, Crazy Climber and Crazy Kong benefit as well.

- Use version 1.1 of Z80Em by Marcel de Kogel. Faster!
  (note that I had to make a couple of changes to Z80.c to make Crazy
  Climber work).

- Handle IN and OUT instructions in the same way as memory accesses (table
  of handler functions). The parameters of the functions are the same, so
  the same function can be used both for memory and ports.
  Had to change the driver structure, removed the pointers to _in and _out
  functions and added port_read and port_write array pointers.
  Also defined a generic interrupt_vector_w() function, this makes the Pac
  Man driver tinier (look at pacman/machine.c, it's now there only to handle
  the cheat).


0.3
---

Program:
- Donkey Kong support (wrong colors, no sound)

- New definition of custom video modes, this will hopefully be compatible
  with more systems.

- Lady Bug and Crazy Climber should run a little faster on slow machines
  (Crazy Climber is still too slow, I know).

Source:
- new general purpose readinputport() function used to handle reads of
  input ports and dip switches. This saves some work when creating a
  game driver. Required changes to struct MachineDriver.

- struct GfxLayout now contains a planeoffset array instead of
  planeincrement, to better support more than 2 bitplanes. I also fixed
  (I hope) all the code which assumed 2 bitplanes. struct GfxDecodeInfo
  had to be changed as well.
