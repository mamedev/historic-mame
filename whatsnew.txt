0.112
-----

Happy 10th Anniversary! Today's release marks 10 years since the
original release of 0.1. After 10 years, hundreds of developers,
thousands of games, and tens of thousands (if not more) of hours of
hard work, MAME development is still going strong. Thanks to everyone
who has supported this project over the years!

To recognize all the work that has gone into the project, this
version's whatsnew includes all the whatsnew reports dating back to
the 3rd release of MAME. Take a good look at the full history of MAME!

Also a big thanks goes out to everyone who has contributed. Although
I am certain there are some people left out of this list, it should
give an indication of just how many people truly care about preserving
arcade history:

==========================================================================

0.111u6

Source Changes
--------------

Fixed the data fetch and scrolling calculation for almost all video 
modes in the Amiga driver. [Ernesto Corvi]

Emulated the trench circuit in Space Encounters. [Adam Bousley]

Added win_output_debug_string_utf8(); a UTF-8 wrapper for
OutputDebugString(). Changed code to use it. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed the disassembly, operation, and cycle timing of many Thumb 
instructions in the ARM7 core. [MooglyGuy]

Defined new osd core function osd_is_absolute_path(). Changed behavior
of core fileio so that absolute paths are identified and search paths
ignored in that case. [Nathan Woods]

Improved validity check for coinage order so that it prints out the
correct order if an error is detected. [Ernesto Corvi]

Fixed clocks and other details in Dream World based on new
measurements. [David Haywood, Guru]

Implemented video circuits in the Midway 8080 driver based on
schematics. Note that this affected the visible area, so overlays will
need to be adjusted. Standardized the visible area across all games.
Implemented Phantom II cloud generator. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Changed the contract of the tilemap_create() call so that it is
guaranteed to succeed or die trying. Cleaned up code paths that 
checked the result of this operation to be simpler as a result.
[Atari Ace, Aaron Giles]

Added preliminary support for the built-in effects DSP in the SCSP, 
which lots of games use for reverb, QSound, and other effects. 
[ElSemi]

Removed archaic i8080_EXACT flag from the 8085 core. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Updated Midway 8080 driver to use properly computed video timings and
scanline interrupts. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed assertion in MPU4 driver. Fixed the mechanical meter operation,
enabling coin entry in Connect 4. [James Wallace]

Added mappings for break and pause keys. [Dirk Best]

Incorporated changes to MESS CPU cores to fix asserts and improve
Z80GB emulation. [Nathan Woods, Wilbert Pol]

Correctly connected sound IRQ in GX400/Nemesis driver. [R. Belmont]

Rewrote the SN76477 emulator from scratch. The main difference between 
the old one and the new one is that it is based on measurements from a
real chip. Also the emulator is fully analog, meaning that 
timings/frequencies, etc. are based on voltage levels. This gives a 
much more true-to-life emulation where the weird behavior of the real 
chip comes emulated for free. The code itself is also a lot simpler 
and more understandable. [Zsolt Vasvari, Derrick Renaud]

Cleaned up stray variables from the crosshair drawing removal. Also
removed some orphaned function declarations. [Oliver Stoneberg]

Added the missing volume and frequency controls to the Berzerk driver
and s14001a core. Fixed the issue with random words being spoken 
instead of the proper ones. Word is now latched at the proper time.
[Lord Nightmare]

Implemented flickering of the strobe light in Space Encounters, to be
eventually connected with artwork. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Changed driver_add/find/remove functions to fatalerror if they cannot
find their targets. [Aaron Giles]

Added support for screenless drivers. [Aaron Giles, Nathan Woods]

Fixed a couple of errors introduced in the OKI6295 pin shuffling.
[David Haywood]

Cleaned up DIP switches and added documentation to the Outrun driver.
[Brian Troha]

Fixed sound clock frequency in the NMG5 driver. [Brian Troha]

Fixed sound clock frequency in Night Slasher. [Sonikos]

Updated Sega System 16/18 drivers to be mono, and swapped button 1/2
to match instruction card. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Moved some of the tool sources to a new subdirectory tools.
[Aaron Giles]

Tweaked the main makefile to better support parallel builds.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed line array from mame_bitmap. Converted dozens of drivers over
to using BITMAP_ADDR macros instead. [Aaron Giles]

Changed automatic crosshairs so they are not quite so automatic.
They now need to be explicitly specified by the driver in the input
ports. Also changed the PORT_CROSSHAIR macro to take a shorter form
of the axis name. Updated all lightgun drivers to have this macro in
its default state. [Aaron Giles]

Added sliders for debugging crosshair positioning (debug build only).
[Aaron Giles]

Changed xevious to use irq0_assert_line instead of irq0_pulse_line
to prevent it from dropping interrupts. [Aaron Giles]

Changed Gorf to use HOLD_LINE instead of PULSE_LINE for scanline
interrupts. The timing is still off, but the game runs now.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed time H/V position reporting during the first frame of execution
using the new video routines. [Aaron Giles]

[James Wallace]

Updated built-in expat code to version 2.0. [Atari Ace]

Fixed sound samples in Indian Battle. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added state saving to mhavoc. Also fixed sparkling vectors so 
slowdowns and vector list overflows can be expected. It looks much 
nicer, though. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Removed XORs from almost all CPS2 games in place of proper emulation
of the encryption. [Nicola Salmoria]

Added sound effects emulation to the Berzerk driver. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed font aspect ratio on non-1:1 resolutions. [Aaron Giles]

Added mechanism to cache a binary format of BDF fonts for improved
loading speed. Also added a bit of progress when loading huge BDF
fonts so that you know what's happening. [Aaron Giles]

Removed gross TMS9928a configuration in place of more standard
techniques. Updates the Cliffhanger and sg1000a drivers accordingly.
[Aaron Giles]

Source Changes
--------------

Added support for the Pioneer PR-8210 laserdisc player.
[Ernesto Corvi]

Added two new convenience macros for input ports: PORT_DIPUNUSED and
PORT_DIPUNUSED_DIPLOC. [stephh]

Updated DIP switches in the cave driver and added locations. [stephh]

Improved DIP switches in sbrkout and converted "fake" DIP switches
into configuration switches. [stephh]

Improved DIP switches in Zero Hour. [Mike Ellery]

Added DIP locations to the m90 driver. [Brian Oberholtzer]

Unified the Forgotten Worlds driver with the cps1 driver and
connected the OKI6295 pin control properly. [David Haywood]

Modified the makefile to make it possible to independently specify
symbols generation and optimization levels. [Atari Ace]

Fixed system time counters in the Amiga code. [Ernesto Corvi]

Major rewrite of the Midway 8080 black & white driver, separating it
from the huge 8080bw driver and making the following changes:
[Zsolt Vasvari, Derrick Renaud]

  - 'True-to-hardware' emulation of the shifting circuits
  - Identified and stubbed sound triggers
  - Fixed DIP switches, where necessary (most games)
  - Added DIPLOCATION to all switches
  - Added watchdog
  - Added coin counter
  - Added lamp outputs to Sea Wolf, Guided Missile, Space Encounters,
     Phantom II, Bowling Alley
  - Added stereo sound to Gun Fight, Guided Missile, M-4
  - Partial sound emulation in Tornado Baseball, Boot Hill,
     Desert Gun, Double Play, Dog Patch, Blue Shark
  - Properly emulated shifter circuit in Boot Hill
  - Added gun recoil output to Desert Gun
  - Added second set of analog controls to Clowns
  - Fixed analog controls in Dog Patch
  - Added SN76477 sound effect to Space Encounters
  - Added non-memory mapped coin counters to Space Invaders,
     Blue Shark, and Space Invaders II
  - Added proper watchdog times to all the games
  - Breadboarded the noise clocks and ensured their frequencies
     were correct

Added support for the lamp matrix to the video callback in the 
Scorpion 2 driver, and updated lamps and inputs to better fit the 
new UI. VFD support has been moved to a configuration switch, as 
the output is actually always occurring - the switch mimics the 
effect of plugging in or removing the VFD from the control point.
[James Wallace]

Improved sound output in the MediaGX driver. [Ville Linde]

Preliminary emulation of the TSI S14001A speech synthesizer as found 
in Berzerk/Frenzy (and also Stern pinballs).
[Lord Nightmare, Kevtris, R. Belmont]

Added missing linescroll effect to Magical Cat Adventure and 
Nostradamus. It can be seen in action on the first levels of both 
games. [David Haywood]

Minor cleanup of mind-bending codce is the konamigx driver.
[R. Belmont]

Fixed crash in the Sega System 24 driver. [David Haywood]

Added a validity check that input port names are valid UTF-8 strings.
[Nathan Woods]

Improved DIP switches in the tumbleb.c driver. [stephh]

Added a large update to the legionna driver with much more 
documentation on the protection and other updates. [Angelo Salese]

Added cdp1869 video emulation to the Cidelsa driver. The games still 
don't work due to timing and interrupt issues. [Curt Coder]

Fixed crash in Tao Taido driver. [David Haywood]

Made suprnova RLE rendering safe from out-of-bounds accesses.
[David Haywood]

Many improvements to the Midnight Landing driver, including partial
sound, partial video emulation, and controls. Still not working,
though. [Tomasz Slanina]

Fixed TMS9928 so it recalculates the pattern mask when its 
dependancies change so we don't end up in weird half-modes.
[R. Belmont]

Added support in the user interface to render all text assuming it is
UTF-8 encoded. This means that UTF-8 encoded Unicode names can be
used in in-game descriptions, etc. But first you will need a unicode
capable BDF font. [Aaron Giles]

Removed Vista build hacks from windows.mak as they are no longer
necessary. [Aaron Giles]

Removed hacky use of the 'depth' field of mame_bitmaps. Bitmaps are
now allocated with an enumerated 'format' instead. This is internally
translated into bits-per-pixel in a normalized way. Also removed 
Machine->color_depth, which was often misused. [Aaron Giles]

Added new macro BITMAP_ADDR that can be used for addressing into
bitmaps. Removed the use of bitmap->line[] in the core code. The 
line[] array will eventually be obsoleted, so stop using it.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed operation of plot_pixel, read_pixel, and plot_box. The first
two are now inline functions and the latter just maps to fillbitmap
via another inline function. [Aaron Giles]

Added new required machine driver entry MDRV_SCREEN_FORMAT() which
specifies the bitmap format for the screen. Removed the 
VIDEO_RGB_DIRECT and VIDEO_NEEDS_6BITS_PER_GUN flags that used to
determine the bitmap format implicity. [Aaron Giles]

Deprecated the following obsolete machine driver entries:

   MDRV_FRAMES_PER_SECOND -> MDRV_SCREEN_REFRESH_RATE
   MDRV_VBLANK_DURATION   -> MDRV_SCREEN_VBLANK_TIME(TIME_IN_USEC(x))
   MDRV_VISIBLE_AREA      -> MDRV_SCREEN_VISIBLE_AREA

[Aaron Giles]

Added a new mechanism for rendering the crosshairs on lightgun games.
Crosshairs are automatically rendered if lightgun controllers are
specified; the game no longer has to render them. Any other analog
axis can be configued to use crosshairs via the new PORT_CROSSHAIR
macro. Crosshairs are also now rendered in different colors for 
different players, and done as an overlay using the new rendering 
system instead of drawing into the game bitmap, which means they no 
longer show up on screenshots. If you don't like the built-in 
crosshairs, you can make your own. Just call them cross0.png 
(player 1), cross1.png (player 2), etc. and place them in the root 
of your artwork directory. [Aaron Giles]

Changed F1 crosshair toggle. By default crosshairs are on for all
configured players. Toggling once will turn them all off. Each
sucessive toggle will enable one player at a time until all players
are again visible. [Aaron Giles]

Added support in chd.c for lossy compressors, computing CRCs and other
hashes based on the decompressed output in those cases. Also added
support for asynchronous reads/writes using the new osd work item
interfaces. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed several bugs in the Windows implementation of the osd work item
interfaces. [Aaron Giles]

Simplified the hard disk interfaces a bit. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed several bugs and improved emulation of the Z80 SIO chip.
[Aaron Giles]

Improved behavior of the laserdisc code when seeking so it doesn't
get "stuck". Added preliminary support for the 22VP932 laserdisc
player. [Aaron Giles]

OSD porters take note of the changes to the OSD core routines.


Source Changes
--------------

Added save state support to the tubep driver. [Svante Gerhard]

Added save state support to the steppers module. [James Wallace]

Added the remaining input pins to the SN76477 Interface. If these 
pins are constant, they can now be defined in the structure as 
opposed to having to call functions in an init routine. Modified all 
the drivers that use a 76477. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Removed file I/O functions from osd_tool.h in favor of the ones in
osdepend.h. Updated tools accordingly. Added new flag
OSD_FLAG_CREATE_PATHS to the open command. [Nathan Woods]

Moved OKIM6295 pin 7 state (internal divider) to internal structure. 
Updated all drivers to specify pin state when setting the interface. 
Added comments for all cases where the original frequency wasn't / 132 
or /165 as the real pin state is unknown. [David Haywood]

Updated Toki driver to display visual DIPs for the game.
[Brian Oberholtzer]

Added sprite X flip and removed unneeded hack in wheelfir driver.
[Tomasz Slanina]

Fixed several issues with the new Unicode support. [Nathan Woods]

Changed uimenu.c to allow displaying DP switch banks which have 
gaps (unused switches) in them. These switches are now grayed out.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Another Amiga update: [Ernesto Corvi]
 - Fixed blitter in line mode
 - Modified Copper to run on odd memory bus cycles
 - Fixed screen delay offset when display data fetch is not word 
    aligned

Fixed cheat searching. [stephh]

Replaced CPS2 CHDs with preliminary decryption function.
[Andreas Naive, Nicola Salmoria]

Added code to validate that banks are only set to point to memory
that has been allocated via auto_malloc(). Currently disabled
pending further review. [Nathan Woods]

Updated input port tokenization for MESS. Added support in MAME
for "configuration" switches which are separate from DIP switches.
These can be used to configure aspects of the game that don't
correspond to DIP switches. Modified pacman.c to use configurations
to control the speedup options. [Nathan Woods, Aaron Giles]

Fixed invalid array access in the taito_l driver. [Atari Ace]

Made a fix minor compiler compatibility tweaks to the source.
[Atari Ace]

Fixed several glitches and crashes related to the input port and
unicode changes from u2. [Aaron Giles]

Separated "core" OSD function definitions to osdcore.h. Added more
extensive documentation. [Aaron Giles]

Created a new library called osdcore, which is now built and linked
to each executable. Moved all definitions of expected components of
osdcore into new header file osdcore.h, and added consistent
documentation for them all. Removed osd_tool.c, and moved the 
necessary parts of its functionality into osdcore. [Aaron Giles]

Defined a new set of interfaces for osdcore which creates an
abstract interface for queueing work items to be potentially executed
on a secondary thread. Implemented the Windows versions of these
routines, but have not done any testing yet. [Aaron Giles]

Separated Windows OSD core routines into individual files, as
folows:
  windir.c  - directory-related core OSD functions
  winfile.c - file-related core OSD functions
  winmisc.c - miscellaneous core OSD functions
  winsync.c - synchronization-related core OSD functions
  wintime.c - timing-related core OSD functions
  winwork.c - threading-related core OSD functions
[Aaron Giles]

Created new osdmini directory with minimal implementations of all the 
OSD core routines. These can be used to stub in functionality or as
a starting point for new ports. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up chdman, normalizing its behavior and improving error
reporting. [Aaron Giles]

More updates to the laserdisc emulation, based on more complete
understanding of how the discs are encoded and how they will 
eventually be stored. [Aaron Giles]

MAMETesters bugs fixed (there are probably more)
-----------------------
tourtabl0111u1red [Nathan Woods]


Source Changes
--------------

Amiga core system updates: [Ernesto Corvi]
 - Updated 6526/8520 CIA to be able to set the value of the SP pin.  
    This is needed to emulate the Amiga keyboard.
 - Updated the custom chips emulation to delay for about 24 cycles 
    the issuing of interrupts after a write to INTENA or INTREQ. 
 - Fixed a bug where if INTREQ got cleared programatically, it would 
    'forget' about pending CIA interrupts, causing the CIA to stop 
    sending further interrupts.
 - Fixed the interrupt delay logic. Now it properly delays firing 
    the irqs, not the masking/disabling.
 - Fixed return value for unused/invalid custom registers reads.
 - Added Denise ID custom register to properly identify OCS, ECS and 
    AGA
 - Added reset to custom, autoconfig and cia when a RESET opcode is 
    found.
 - Resetting the custom chips will now clear INTENA, preventing 
    further interrupts.
 - Fixed a bug in the RBF interrupt request code check.
 - Fixed a bug on the 6526/8520 CIA that prevented chained counters 
    from working.
 - Added support for the 'blitter-nasty' bit on the blitter. Fixes 
    many games that displayed wrong graphics.

Hooked up coin counter in Gun Fight. Also connected sounds properly 
per schematics. Added proper watchdogs to invaders and invad2ct.
[Derrick Renaud]

Added missing initialization to the TMS5220 RNG. [Lord Nightmare]

Taito JC driver improvements: [Ville Linde]
 - Implemented MC68HC11 communications
 - Added analog controls via MC68HC11
 - Various bug fixes and some new opcodes to the TMS320C51 core
 - Moved video hardware emulation to vidhrdw/taitojc.c
 - Implemented 3D hardware emulation

Cleaned up the 8080bw sound changes included with u1. [Robert]

Changed 6532riot and tia code to only allow initialization at init 
time. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed several bugs in the old System 16 bootleg code. [Mamesick]

Fixed SIM opcode in i8085 emulator. [Tomasz Slanina]

Initial support for Unicode in the core and Windows OSD: [Nathan Woods]
 - text file reading/writing now automatically handle UTF-8 conversion
 - a number of Windows functions internally manage TCHARs
 - new Windows compile-time option UNICODE can be used to build MAME
    as a Unicode application (see windows.mak)

Added new visible representation of physical DIP switches for drivers
that have them defined. To see this, just pull up the DIP switch
menu on drivers that have been documented. [Brian Oberholtzer]

Corrected some incorrect DIP switch information in the 1942, toaplan2,
and segag80r drivers. [Brian Oberholtzer]

Added the remaining MESS CPU cores to MAME. They are disabled in the
build, but will be maintained along with the MAME CPU cores as future
changes are made. [Nathan Woods]

Added support for multiple instances of the samples sound system.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Converted input port definitions from code-based constructors to
data-driven tokenized values. This reduces the overall MAME code size
by a significant amount. Note that the tokenization is a bit
different for 32-bit versus 64-bit builds, so hopefully somebody
with a 64-bit system can verify that it works (mame -listxml should
produce identical results to the 32-bit version). 
[Atari Ace, Aaron Giles]

Properly implemented sound interrupts in Night Slashers. [Aaron Giles]

Improved cycle timings in the ARM CPU core. Altered the deco32 CPU
clocks to be more realistic. [Aaron Giles]

Updated copyright dates in header files and docs. [Aaron Giles]

Source Changes
--------------

Added more documentation for the 8080bw driver. It describes the ports 
and bits for those games with no sound. In most cases, sample sounds 
have been attached, in order to assist with further development. The 
games modified are: invrvnge/invrvnga, rollingc, spcenctr, gunfight, 
m4, gmissile, schasrcv, 280zzzap, lagunar, lupin3, phantom2, blueshrk, 
desertgu, ballbomb, yosakdon/yosakdoa, and shuttlei. Two games were 
marked NO_SOUND although they actually do have sound: these are cosmo 
and dogpatch. [Robert]

Moved a chunk of platform specific code out of chdcd.c and romcmp.c 
into the osd_tool code. [Nathan Woods]

Widespread cleanup of disassemblers and CPU interfaces across the 
project: [Giuseppe Gorgoglione]
 - removed from many disassemblers the dependency on eainfo.h. The 
    output produced by those disassemblers has been checked to be the 
    same as before.
 - extensively rewrote the 6309dasm.c and 6809dasm.c disassemblers.
 - fixed minor bugs in the v810 and hd6309 interfaces.
 - removed m68000\cpudefs.h. This was used by the old assembly m68000 
    core. Removed from m68kmame.c and m68kmame.h as well many 
    references to the old core (e.g A68K0, A68K2, etc.)
 - properly typedeffed the cpuinfo union, this affects cpuintrf.h and 
    many, many, other files
 - converted 8051dasm.c, m65ce02.c and t11dasm.c to use 
    cpuintrf_temp_str() instead of local string pools
 - moved the info.s = cpuintrf_temp_str() initialization to:
    activecpu_get_info_string(), cpunum_get_info_string() and 
    cputype_get_info_string(). This allows us to remove tons of 
    info->s = cpuintrf_temp_str() statements from the xxx_get_info() 
    accessors of every CPU core, making them more readable
 
Fixed a problem with the chirp tables of both the tms5220 and the 
tms5110. Also backported Jarek's PRNG implementation from tms5110.c 
to tms5220.c so it no longer relies on rand(). [Lord Nightmare]

Fixed two bugs in the m68000 core: [Alex Jackson]
 - fixed a miscompilation issue with GCC4 that was first noticed in 
    Altered Beast but also affected Moonwalker, Galaxy Force 2, and 
    probably many other games.  
 - fixed the core's compile-time self-configuration so that it uses 
    the same code paths on LP64 platforms (64-bit Linux, etc.) as on
    LLP64 (64-bit Windows) and 32-bit platforms.

Added save state support to the magmax driver. [Svante Gerhard]

Fixed music speed in perfrman. [Mamesick]

Fixed implementation of da_a instruction in i8051 core. [Special LIU]

Third round of numerous improvements to the cheat engine: [ShimaPong]
NOTE : delete old command code and save it newly in Options menu.
 * operation:
   - Added preliminary direct Program Space accessor.
     You can hack custom handling ROM code (eg encrypted segas16b.c
     games). But it has several problems.
     And added watchpoint display for Program Space.
   - Added new operation, "Write if Match".
     The cheat engine writes value only when read value matched
     reserved value which is stored in extend data field.
 * search menu:
   - Added 3rd search mode, "Minimum Search Mode". It's more simple
     than Classic Mode. Also added search memory initialize with
     ui_clear key and extended value edit with arrow key in this mode.
   - Added "View Last Results", "Restore Result", "Region Selection"
     items to the advanced search menu.
 * result viewer:
   - Don't open this menu to avoid MAME crash in case of
     no search region like sms.c in HazeMD.
   - Added quick page switch by left/right arrow key.
     Also changed functions for several keys in this menu.
   - Improved no result page skip. But incomplete because
     doesn't skip first or last page even if no result.
 * code loading:
   - Ignored to load old format code by default. If you need to
     load, choose "Load Old Format" item in Options menu.
 * input:
   - Fixed activation key save on Enable/Disable menu.
   - Fixed key handling for watch code addition from watch list
     menu to cheat list. Now it works with ctrl + save cheat
     key on the watch list menu.
   - Enabled ui_clear key in editing a value (clear data)
     and on watch list menu (reset all watchpoints).
 * option:

     This function works in Enable/Disable, Add/Edit, Search and
     Watchpoint menus.
   - Rearranged several items on the menus.

 * Implemented various dsp56k opcodes
 * Polygonet Commanders now gets past the memory tests

Fixed the background color in perfrman. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Merged in some MESS-specific PC support code. [Nathan Woods]

Added mosaic effect to valtric. Yes, it looks as bad on real hardware
as in MAME :) [Tomasz Slanina]

Fixed colors in Honey Dolls. [David Haywood]

Added the final filtering stages to the sound, proper watchdog and 
memory mirroring to the circusc driver. Also added PORT_DIPLOCATION 
info and save state support. [Derrick Renaud]

Updated vconv.c to support preprocessor and assembly file output in
MSVC builds. [Nathan Woods]

Improved DIP switches for Honey Dolls and Twin Adventure. 
[Brian Troha]

Removed the "Autocenter Speed" menu entry for Analog Controls that do 
not use it. [Derrick Renaud]

Added a "Digital Speed" of 0 in the "Analog Controls" menu. This will 
cause the control to only inc/decrement once per button press no 
matter how long the button is pressed. Remember this is still scaled 
by the "Sensitivity" setting. [Derrick Renaud]

Scaled Windows mouse Z axis by 30 to make it usable. Most mice 
inc/decrement by 120 for each wheel click. Some rare ones are 30. So 
this means for most mice, using a Sensitivity setting of 25%, you 
will get 1 inc/decrement for each wheel click. [Derrick Renaud]

Cleaned up the cclimber driver, replacing hacks for cannonb with a
separate video update callback. [Mamesick]

Moved the ST-V protection related code into stvprot.c and added some 
notes about the decathlete protection and renamed stvhacks to 
stvinit, because it contains most of the inits as well as the 
speedhacks. [David Haywood]

Major funworld driver rewrite: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Merged/splitted some machine drivers, memory maps and inputs.
 - Unified get_bg_tile_info for all games.
 - Mapped the input buttons in a better format (all games).
 - Added proper color PROM decode routines.

 - Decrypted jolycdae and managed the planes to show correct colors.

Minor Unicode changes for the Windows code. [Nathan Woods]

Added serial in/out support to the Amiga hardware. Added hooks for
output pins and light pen positioning. Also fixed the horrible static 
at startup in the debug build. [Aaron Giles]

Reorganized the laserdisc support a bit to accommodate new players.
Added Sony LDP-1450 support. [Aaron Giles]

Added new render texture format TEXFORMAT_YUY16, which is used to
hold 4:2:2 Y/Cb/Cr format pixels. Updated the Windows Direct3D code
and the software renderers to use this format directly. [Aaron Giles]

Added new render texture fromat TEXFORMAT_PALETTEA16, which is the
same as TEXFORMAT_PALETTE16 but respects the alpha component of the
palette entry. Updated the Windows Direct3D code and the software
renderers to use this format. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the render system to respect blendmodes for screen elements
rather than hard-coding them. This allows individual VIDEO_UPDATE
routines to do their own compositing. [Aaron Giles]

Removed the illusion from the rendering system that you could pass in
arbitrary palettes. The system palette is all that is supported.

raiga0104u4yel [Mamesick]


Source Changes
--------------

SCSI CD emulation improvements: [Ville Linde]
 - Added Play Audio (12) command
 - Fixed track number and added MSF support to Read Sub-Channel 
    command

Added workaround for broken MediaGX driver. [Ville Linde]

Reworked the SNES raster timing to use MDRV_SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS() and 
friends. All but one of the "electronics tests" in the SNES 
diagnostics cart now pass with flying colors. [R. Belmont]

Fixed Super Breakout layout. [Mr. Do]

CPS2 updates: [David Haywood]
 - Added table for Jyangoku (from Guru). Note that GFX/Sound roms 
    aren't dumped on this one.
 - Removed old 'handcrafted' xors for games which we have CHDs for 
    and replaced them with xors generated from MAME using the CHD.  
    This means anyone with the CHD can easily generate the xors 
    (using the code I've left in there) if they need to be able to 
    run the games with a shorter startup time.
 - Disabled the loading of the xors by default for all sets with a 
    CHD. Now only the CHD is loaded, unless the #define is changed 
    at the top in which case only the xors generated from the CHD 
    are loaded.

Added support for more than 4 mouse buttons on versions of Windows 
that support it. Win98/Me with DX7+ or XP. It defaults to regular 4 
buttons if not supported. [Derrick Renaud]

Fixed the crosshairs in the PlayChoice-10 gun games that got 
buggered in the conversion to multi-monitor support. [Derrick Renaud]

Rewrote the Dragon's Lair driver from the schematics. Added new
module machine/laserdsc.c which has laserdisc emulation for the
PR-7280 and LD-V1000 laserdisc players. Full emulation of the
laserdisc is pending support for CHD audio/video and high quality 
rips, but you can operate the game and see the frame numbers that
would be displayed. Added built-in layout to display the scores, 
lives, and credit information. [Aaron Giles]

Added some hacks to windows.mak to allow limping compilation under
Windows Vista. To make these work set an environment variable called
VISTA_MINGW_ROOT equal to the base of your mingw directory, and add
%VISTA_MINGW_ROOT%\libexec\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2 to your PATH environment.
There are still a few issues, but this will let you build with MSVC,
and will compile most of the code with gcc (minus a couple of Windows
OSD files). Hopefully the mingw folks will resolve these issues.

    gfx in batmanfr)
 - vdp2: fixed vertical line scrolling for zoomed layers (fixes
    corrupted backgrounds in astrass)
 - stv:  added speedup for master sh2 in batmanfr

Fixed bug in overflow handling and SUBC emulation in the TMS32010
core. [Rainer Keuchel]

Reverted Mario Bros. graphics offset since it caused issues 
elsewhere. [Derrick Renaud]

Enhanced chd.c to support hunk sizes up to 16MB, versus the previous
64k limit. [Aaron Giles]

Added hooks to chd.c to specify codec-specific configuration info.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed obsolete timing parameter from stream_update(). [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up cdrom.c. Removed audio implementation and relocated code
into sound/cdda.c. Changed metadata format to be textual instead of
binary (old metadata format is still supported). Removed external
access to CHD positions; all accesses are now done at the physical
LBA level and converted internally. [Aaron Giles]

Added support for split CHD files. CHD files can be transparently
split into multiple pieces and left that way during read access.
Modifications to split files are always written to the last file.
A new command chdman -split is now available to split an existing
CHD file. [Aaron Giles]

Added new option -fontpath to control where the font files are loaded
from. [Aaron Giles]

Added ability for options_add_entries() to override defaults 
specified in the core. To do this, simply include an option in the
list with the same name as the core option and provide a new default.
This default will override the one specified in the core.

Fixed flags access in the i286 core. [Barry Rodewald]

Updated MC146818 module to use new core date/time routines.
[Nathan Woods]

Cleaned up disassemblers to remove stubs and ensure the disassemblers
are not referenced except in debug builds. [Nathan Woods]

Added support for using CHDs to decrypt CPS2 games. This code is
disabled for the moment, but will be enabled in the future. Only a 
handful of games have complete tables so far. These tables are huge 
(~4GB) and uncompressable until the encryption algorithm is 
understood. [David Haywood]

Fixed bug in the debugger that caused watchpoints to not be active
until the next context switch. [smf]

Cleaned up the input definitions for n-way joysticks so they are
more explicit. Added concept of a "16-way" joystick, which is a
joystick that doesn't prevent simultaneous opposing directions from
bring reported. [smf]

Major System 573 update: [smf]
 * fixed PSX SIO control register behavior
 * implemented several SCSI CD commands: START/STOP UNIT, PAUSE/
    RESUME, READ SUB-CHANNEL, READ TOC

Fixed upside down service mode in the commando.c driver. [Canim]

Added support for the Triple Hunt 8-track audio. [Derrick Renaud]

Galaxian/Scramble driver reorganization: [Atari Ace]
 * machine/scramble.c is broken up into two files, 
    machine/galaxian.c and machine/scramble.c
 * drivers/amidar.c, drivers/frogger.c, drivers/scobra.c get copies 
    of some of the data structures they shared from other drivers 
 * galaxian_base is made static and uses outside of the main driver
    were rewritten
 * cclimber_decode code from drivers/cclimber.c was separated into 
    its own machine/cclimber.c file to allow mshuttle to share it 
    without taking on other dependencies

Added missing x-flipping support in Major Havoc. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Made some improvements to trivia madness driver. There still is 
something wrong in the question roms banking. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

More updates to the ST-V driver: [Mariusz Wojcieszek]
 * vdp1: added shading for sprites (used by znpwfv, cotton, others)
 * vdp1: fixed sprite clipping (fixes incorrect sprites in znpwfv)
 * vdp1: fixed transparency on colour lookup table sprites (fixes bad
          sprites in znpwfv)
 * vdp2: fixed caching of RGB layer (fixes bad backgrounds on bosses 
          in rsgun)
 * vdp2: added additive blending for tilemaps and sprites (rsgun)
 * vdp2: added vertical line scroll and linezoom (fixes diehard logo)
 * stv:  improved speedups for diehard
 * stv:  fixed speedups for znpwfv
 * stv:  added preliminary save state support

Significant cleanup of chd.c: [Aaron Giles]
 * got rid of the horrible last_error concept; now all routines 
    return an error directly
 * fixed several issues in managing metadata 
 * changed compression and verification routines to be client-driven 
    rather than monolithic
 * changed internal codec usage to be more flexible
 * altered chdman and MAME to use the new interfaces
 * added new -createraw command for creating raw data CHDs

Fixed crash bug in romcmp when comparing ZIP files. [Aaron Giles]

[Ville Linde]

Polygonet Commanders update: [Andrew Gardner]
 * Added more accurate host interface to dsp56k core
 * Removed a bunch of hacks in plygonet.c

Added new field Machine->basename which is used to describe the path
used for various file accesses. This is a helper for MESS, and should
not have any user-visible changes. The file accesses affected are:
configuration (cfg) files, snapshots, debugger comments, NVRAM,
and memory cards. [Aaron Giles]

Changed naming of screenshots. They are now created in separate
folders per game, with numeric names 0000.png, 0001.png, etc.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed artwork layout loading to load either gamename/gamename.lay
or gamename/default.lay. The latter is preferred, and allows for
easier reuse of layouts between games. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed max instruction bytes for 68020+ CPUs to avoid assertion in
new disassembler. [Aaron Giles]

Added flip screen offsets needed with new video parameters in the
pacman.c driver. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed subtle bug in the UI menu handler that only manifested on
mingw-based compiles. [Nicola Salmoria]

Updated CHD locating behavior to accept CHDs referenced by the 
parent of a clone if the hash matches, even if it has a different
name. [smf]

Improved flash emulation and added support for Fujitsu flash chips.
Switches Konami games over to new flash chips. [smf]

Improved behavior of SCSI CD implementation for audio playback and
TOC reading commands. [R. Belmont]

Fixed priorities and the offset of layer 3 in fcrash. [robiza]

Added save state support to the COP4xx core. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the new disassembler and override callback prototypes to
take const parameters and to remove the generally unused 'bytes'
parameter. The disassemblers can now assume that the buffers contain
enough bytes to hold the maximum instruction length as returned by
the CPU core get_info callback. [Aaron Giles]

Converted the following disassemblers to the new format, and added
step in/out support where it was obvious: adsp21xx, alph8201, 
arm, arm7, asap, ccpu, cdp1802, cop4x0, dsp32c, e132xs, g65816, 
h6280, h83002, i8x41, i960, i8051, i8085, jaguar, m680x, m6805,

and z8000. [Aaron Giles]

Deprecated the old disassembler interfaces in favor of the new ones.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed subtle bug in subtable allocation in the memory system that
caused the Eolith games to assert with the debugger. [Aaron Giles]

Tweaked the disassembly view to detect if the disassembly for the
current instruction has changed, and if so, recompute the entire 
view. This provides more dynamic updating when system states change
under certain CPUs. [Aaron Giles]

Added new symbol 'curpc' for all CPUs which represents the value of
the current instruction pointer, to avoid naming conflicts with the
'pc' register in other contexts. Changed this to be the default
value for the disassembly window in the Windows version of the
debugger (OSD ports will need to do likewise). [Aaron Giles]

  mame_printf_error
  mame_printf_warning
  mame_printf_info
  mame_printf_debug

to output data. By default, these go to the console, but they can be
overridden by the OSD layer to route wherever is appropriate.

IMPORTANT NOTE TO OSD DEVELOPERS: As of this release, you are now
required to make use of options.c to set core options. At a minimum,
this requires calling options_init(NULL) before calling run_game().

capbowl0109u1yel [Aaron Giles]


Source Changes
--------------

Improved DIP switches in the yunsun16 driver and added more
documentation. [stephh]

Improved timer accuracy and added save state support to the 
6526 CIA module. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed bug in memory map dumping code that caused wrong addresses
to be dumped. [Wilbert Pol]

Connected TMS5220 speech support to the Major Havoc: Return to Vax
mod. [Jess Askey]

Changed comment shortcut in disassembly windows to avoid clash with
Ctrl+C for "Copy". [Nathan Woods]

Added checking for register symbol names to ensure they aren't
numeric (which prevents their identification by the expression
parser). Changed the M4510 CPU symbols to avoid tripping this
check. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed crash in the Win32 debugger code with small window sizes.
[Samuele Zannoli]

Fixed assertion when auditing systems with no samples or ROMs.
[Nathan Woods]

Some pmpoker driver improvements: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Added service/settings mode to pmpoker.
 - Added PORT_IMPULSE to manage correct timings for most inputs 
    in all games.

Fixed "run to cursor" functionality for CPUs that had an address
bus shift. [Andrew Gardner]

Fixed bug that caused false positive ZIP filename matches.
[Aaron Giles]

Added PATH_SEPARATOR define so that platforms with non forward-slash
path separators can get preassembled paths in their native format.
[Aaron Giles]

Some enhancements to the options manager: [Aaron Giles]
 * added a simpler options_init for startup
 * added support for internal options
 * added support for multiple unadorned options
 * moved core options definitions into the core options.c
    (note that the default INI path no longer includes $HOME/.mame
     since that is not cross-platform; *nix platforms will need to
     explicitly override that default in their OSD code)
 * added accessor to set the default value of a given option
 * changed error reporting so that errors are tracked internally
    and reported only once

Improved documentation in osdepend.h to better describe some of the
functions and provide a general overview of how things work. Removed 
unused osd_readkey_unicode function. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug in the bilinear software scaler that would read out of
bounds on a bitmap. [Aaron Giles]

Added supervisor DAC support to the Max-a-Flex driver. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed clock speeds on Turbo/Buck Rogers. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed -romident with ZIP files. [Aaron Giles]

IMPORTANT NOTE TO OSD DEVELOPERS: The file I/O interface has changed
significantly. It is now much simpler. Please read osdepend.h for
full details on how the new OSD-defined functions work. In addition,
you must now use the options.c to specify your search paths. If you
are parsing standard command line options and INI files, this work
is relatively straightforward. Otherwise, you can manually call
options_set_string() for each of the search paths to configure them
from whatever options store you are using.

More findout.c/getrivia.c improvements: [wolf676]
 - added ticket dispenser to Trivia/Sexual Trivia
 - found last unknown dipswitch in Selection/Poker
 - added missing "Payout" button; payout hardware unknown 
 - added missing "Play / Raise" button and its lamp 9
 - added "Button 12 ?" to selection, function unknown
 - re-added PORT_IMPULSE(2) to poker games buttons because they do 
    not like it if two or more buttons are held; trivia games still 
    respond better without this
 - changed coin_lockout_global to coin_lockout_w(0) and 
    coin_lockout_w(1) for 2 coin slots in selection; 
 - added missing lamps 11 (coin slot 2), 12 and 13 (unknown) 
    to selection

Fixed crash in the MPU4 driver. [El Condor]

Hooked up ARM ROM for kovsh, though it doesn't work yet. [ElSemi]

Some fixes for the 8080bw driver: [Robert]
 - The correct samples are being used for lrescue, lrescuem, 
    grescue, desterth 
 - Dipswitch corrections for superinv, invadrmr, sinvemag, 
    spceking, spacewr3 
- Remove extraneous beeping noise from indianbt 

Converted all the toaplan2.c games to mono since the PCBs are JAMMA
without external stereo connectors. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Added bounds checking to the qsound driver. [David Haywood]

Redesigned the OSD file I/O interfaces to be simpler and more
straightforward. Also simplified the core's file I/O routines and
included some functionality that was previously left to the OSD
layer. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote unzip.c to return richer errors and generally behave better.
[Aaron Giles]

Rewrote audit.c to simplify the code and not rely on extraneous
functions that were in the old file I/O system. [Aaron Giles]

Simplified the 68000 core generation logic to just produce one
file. Hopefully this will cure some of the build issues with the
core. [Aaron Giles]

 - added external coin counters and coin lockouts
 - fixed lamps in upright and cocktail modes
 - getrivia.c: fixed sound in selection and clone
 - located ticket out bit in trivia games and commented it in 
    both drivers.
 - fixed merge collision from u5

Input port cleanup and additional comments in the CPS1 driver.
[stephh]

Fixed ES5503 behavior for voice volumes > 127 (cures missing 
sounds/music notes in several Apple IIgs demos and games).
[R. Belmont]

Made MSC1937 operation more accurately match datasheet and wiring
diagram. Added indexed getters to the output system to match the
newly introduced setters. [El Condor]

Changed input port calculations to go in two passes, to catch
out-of-order conditionals properly. [HobbesAtPlay]

Fixed priorities in the m62 driver, mainly affecting Lode Runner
sequels. [robiza]

Fixed PNG code so that it doesn't NULL terminate tEXt chunks.
[Mathis Rosenhauer]

Changed disassembler override callbacks to match new disassembler
syntax. [Nathan Woods]

Changed artwork loading to be on-demand rather than all up-front.
Also added a message during artwork resizing/loading so it's more
clear what is going on. [Aaron Giles]

Added new osd function osd_break_into_debugger() which can be hooked
to cause a break into the OSD's debugger when an assertion or
fatal error occurs. Hooked it up on Windows to do just that.
[Aaron Giles]

Normalized exit codes from mame.exe. The core-specific ones are
defined in mame.h. The Windows build will also return code 100 on
an unhandled exception now. [Aaron Giles]

--------------

Fixed priority in galivan and danger (and clones). Added save state
support to all games in galivan.c. Fixed portability issue in DAC
audio save states. [Vas Crabb]

Fixed bug in software renderer that prevented lower-resolution
targets from being properly supported. [smf]

Rewrote the Atari vector generators, using the schematics and actual
state machine PROMs. The state machine is now emulated so timing 
should be much more realistic. Clipping hardware in bzone and others 
is emulated instead of hardcoded. Improved accuracy of clocks and
various other bits of cleanup. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Some more cleanups to the getrivia, findout, and merit drivers:
[wolf676]
 - corrected order of buttons and lamps in the games
 - removed impulse(2) from buttons -> buttons respond much better now
 - added coin 2 to Selection and Trivia
 - Poker and Sexual Trivia have no coin 2 -> unique inputs defined
 - used PORT_INCLUDE() and PORT_MODIFY() where possible
 - connected outputs for use with artwork

Major updates to the Nintendo 64 based driver. [Ville Linde]

More improvements to the pmpoker driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Confirmed the GFX banks (a complete dump appeared!).
 - Improved technical notes and added a PCB layout based on PCB pics.
 - Found and fixed the 3rd bitplane of BigBoy gfx.
 - Renamed Big-Boy to Golden Poker Double Up.
 - Added 'Joker Poker' (Golden Poker version without 'double-up').
 - Added 'Jack Potten's Poker' (same as Joker Poker, but with 
    'Aces or better' instead of jacks).
 - Simulated colors for all sets till color PROMs appear.
 - Completed inputs in all sets (except DIP switches).

Undid previous (incorrect) 'fix' of shangha3 sound clock. [Canim]

Implemented some port conditions for gmgalax, so you only see the
relevant DIP switches for the active game. [Canim]

Numerous fixes to the cheat engine. [ShimaPong]

Updated the TN2A03 CPU to match the proper cycle timings and 
unsupported opcodes revealed by Blargg's NES chip test. [Wilbert Pol]

Another big update to the ST-V driver: [Mariusz Wojcieszek]
 - scsp: improved interrupt reset. diehard, dnmtdeka, vfkids, 
 - colmns97 have sound now
 - vdp1: added mesh effect for the sprites 
 - vdp1: added polylines
 - vdp2: optimized rbg rendering
 - stv:  added speedups for dnmtdeka and diehard
 - stv:  corrected some set names/descriptions

Fixed crash in Windows code if we are unable to create sound buffers.
[Nathan Woods]

Fixed bug that caused Turbo sprites to be exceedingly large.
[Aaron Giles]

Began rewrite of Grand Champion driver. Still work to do on collision
detection, radar, and some glitches. [Aaron Giles]

Added new output utilities: output_set_led_value(), 
output_set_digit_value(), output_set_lamp_value(), which are used to
set a generic indexed data type. Changed Turbo and Max-a-Flex over to
using output_set_digit_value() for their digits. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote the PNG reading/saving code, improving error reporting and

simplifying the code significantly. [Aaron Giles]

--------------

Added support for reverse-order entry in the BFM code. [El Condor]

Cleaned up DIP switches and documentation in the merit.c and 
coinmstr.c drivers. [wolf676]

Updated the MPU4 layout and added more documentation. [El Condor]

Fixed neocrypt.c to work on big-endian machines. [R. Belmont]

Improved DIP switches for spcewars and invadpt2. Fixed sound in
spcewars. [Robert]

Fixed UI for cheat system watchpoints, making them usable again.
[Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed flipscreen mode for liquidk and other games using the same
Taito graphics chips. [Robzia]

Added many more notes/info to the arkanoid driver. [stephh]

Added save state support for YM3812, YM3526 and uPD7759 sound chips, 
and Prehistoric Isle video hardware. Also added partial save state
support for the Y8950 sound chip. [Vas Crabb]

Did a bit of object-orienting the core. All core init functions now
take a running_machine parameter. All exit, reset, and pause 
callbacks now require a running_machine parameter to register, and
pass in the running_machine when called. [Aaron Giles]

Added a running_machine parameter to the following driver callbacks:
  DRIVER_INIT
  MACHINE_START/MACHINE_RESET
  SOUND_START/SOUND_RESET
  VIDEO_START/VIDEO_RESET/VIDEO_EOF/VIDEO_UPDATE
  NVRAM_HANDLER/MEMCARD_HANDLER
For the most part, this didn't affect the code thanks to the macros,
apart from cases where direct calls were made. [Aaron Giles]

Altered most of the mame.c and palette.c interfaces to take a
running_machine parameter. Hung private data for these modules off of
the running_machine structure instead of using global variables.
[Aaron Giles]

Did some cleanup and de-Achoization of the palette code. Removed some
features used only by Grand Champion, which only complicated things
for all the other drivers. Marked Grand Champion as imperfect graphics
until it gets rewritten. [Aaron Giles]

Since I had to visit all call sites of palette_set_color to add the
running_machine parameter, I also updated quite a lot of them to use
the nice palnbit() inlines in palette.h, which cleaned up the code in
many cases. Since this was a manual process, I probably messed up one
or two cases, so if you notice odd colors, please report them to the
http://mametesters.org site. [Aaron Giles]

More Turbo work: cleaned up the sound code, added support for proper
speaker placement in all games, a few other minor fixes. Sprite
scaling is still not 100%, but I need some real hardware to verify.
Apart from that, no further work is planned. [Aaron Giles]

Some nice improvements to the debugger: [Andrew Gardner]
 * added ability to tab between views in the disassembly windows
 * added a 'cursor' to the dasm view and hooked up navigation keys
 * added F4 'run to here' key when the disasm view has focus
 * added F9 'toggle breakpoint' key when the disasm view has focus
 * enhanced memory view keyboard navigation

Added workaround for crash in the sound code under some edge cases.
[David Haywood]

Fixed background ROM loading in the new wbmlbg set. [David Haywood]

Overhauled and corrected the DIP switches in the trivia and quiz 
games in the findout driver. [wolf676]

Fixed 6840 counter behavior in continuous mode. [El Condor]

Identified some unknown DIP switches in Robby Roto. [wolf676]

Big update to the arkanoid driver which improves emulation of some 
bootlegs: [stephh]
 - Interverted 'arkblock' and 'arkbloc2' sets for better comparaison
 - Renamed sets :
    * 'arkbl2' -> 'arkmcubl'
    * 'arkbl3' -> 'arkgcbl'
 - Changed some games descriptions
 - Removed flags from the following sets :
    * 'arkbloc2' (old 'arkblock')
    * 'arkgcbl' (old 'arkbl3')
    * 'paddle2'

Fixed a multithreading race condition at startup. [Nathan Woods]

Added some minimal validation on the sample rate configuration
parameters. [Firewave]

Fixed a few dips and added diplocation setting for Wonder Stick 
in the nmg5.c driver. [Brian Troha]

Big update to the MPU4 driver: [El Condor]
 - added support for reverse clocking in the VFD code. 
 - changed the 6840 to not run the counter clock if no frequency 
    is specified
 - reworked the MPU4 drastically to be more in sync with AGEMAME
 - MPU4 video should now be working a little better
 - deprecated 6850acia.c, replacing it with a specialized driver

Updated core.mak to ensure the make clean will remove file2str.exe.
[Nathan Woods]

Added new ROM loading option, ROM_IGNORE() which works just like
ROM_CONTINUE() except that you don't need to load the data anywhere.
It can be used when larger ROMs are present and only a portion of the
data is used. See solomon.c for an example. [Aaron Giles]

Removed support for the old debugger. [Aaron Giles]

Added driver_data member to the Machine structure, where drivers can
hang data instead of using global variables. Added MDRV_DRIVER_DATA
macro so the core can allocate this structure at startup. Added
AM_BASE_MEMBER and AM_SIZE_MEMBER which are similar to AM_BASE and
AM_SIZE but let you specify a member of a struct hanging off of 
driver_data. Updated the Turbo driver to use these new features as an 
experiment. [Aaron Giles]

More Turbo driver cleanup: [Aaron Giles]
 * doubled the horizontal resolution to better draw analog sprites
 * improved Buck Rogers and Subroc video

Added PORT_DIPLOCATION macros to a number of drivers based on 
research. [Roberto Fresca]

Fixed several issues with pausing and the multithreading code.
[Nathan Woods]

Cleaned up the vacfdisp module to display 14 and 16 segment displays.
Added a separate character set for the OKI MSC1937. Changes Scorpion
2 to the new system. Tidied up the 6840 emulator a bit. [El Condor]

Attempted to fix the bad Space Odyssey ROM by using data from the
previous dump. It is still marked BAD_DUMP (we would like to get an
actual dump), but the new Space Odyssey is now playable. [MASH]

Removed recently-introduced case dependency in the ROM naming.
[Buddabing]

Added new option -multithreading (-mt) which enables the previous
multithreaded rendering code. This code has had problems on some
systems, especially pre-XP systems, so consider it experimental. If
you want to help debug issues, enable LOG_THREADS in windows/window.c
and post them to MAMETesters.org with a description of your problem
and your system. If you don't have hyperthreading, dual core, or a
multi-CPU system, don't bother turning this flag on. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the behavior of the led7seg primitive. It now no longer takes
a state value but accepts states from 0-255, allowing independent
control over all 7 segments and the decimal. Ordered the segments
according to standard order. Updated the Turbo driver to do its own
BCD decoding via an LS48 decoder to control the segments directly.
This will break existing layouts using the led7seg primitive. 
[Aaron Giles]

Further turbo driver cleanup. Still in WIP. [Aaron Giles]
 * derived sprite scaling from PROMs and R/C values (still not 100%)
 * rewrote most of the video/sprite handling
 * identified all PROMs and used them where appropriate
 * added a more complete 8279 implementation
 * converted 7-segment LEDs to the new behavior described above

[David Haywood]

Namco System 22 update: [R. Belmont]
 - Fixed ROM loading problems reported by Guru
 - Hooked up Prop Cycle fan and lamp to the new output system

Added new flag: VIDEO_ALWAYS_UPDATE, which causes the VIDEO_UPDATE
callback to be called even on skipped frames. This should be used
for games where the process of rendering has side effects such as
collision detection that need to always be present. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed the new scanline timing functions to compute things
correctly and without using unnecessary timers. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed inputs in the Sega G80 vector games which were broken in the

Changed render_target_alloc() to take a bitmask of flags. In addition
to loading a single file, targets can also be marked "hidden", and
only non-artwork views can be made visible. [Aaron Giles]

Added new render target layer config flag to disable screen overlays.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed snapshot taking code to render the particular screen to a

Normalized the naming of several functions in video.c, most 
importantly: [Aaron Giles]

   force_partial_update -> video_screen_update_partial
   configure_screen -> video_screen_configure
   set_visible_area -> video_screen_set_visarea

Added new functions that do accurate per-screen timing based on
video parameters: [Aaron Giles]

   video_screen_get_hpos
   video_screen_get_vpos
   video_screen_get_hblank
   video_screen_get_vblank
   video_screen_get_time_until_pos

Fixed bug that caused the VIDEO_EOF to be called repeatedly while in
the debugger. [Aaron Giles]

Split render.c into rendutil.c, rendlay.c, and render.c to keep the
code more organized. [Aaron Giles]

Abstracted the notion of outputs. A new module, output.c, now controls
all outputs. Each output is tagged with a name; some standardization
eventually needs to happen on these names, but at the moment it's
fully open. The OSD layer can register with output.c to be notified
when outputs change. From there, it is free to do what it wants. LEDs
have now been converted to outputs with the name "led0", "led1", etc.
[Aaron Giles]

Added support for notifying external clients of changes in output
states in the Windows OSD system. See windows/output.h for a list of
messages that external clients can register to receive. Removed the
built-in hacky LED support in the Windows OSD layer. Created a sample
application ledutil.exe which subscribes to the external events and
routes the "led0", "led1", and "led2" outputs to the keyboard LEDs
just like before. If you want to continue to have LED support, simply
copy ledutil.exe into your startup folder and let it run in the
background. [Aaron Giles]

Modified the Q*Bert driver to signal a "knocker0" output when the
knocker is triggered. [Aaron Giles]

Added new layout element component type "text", which lets you draw
text in the built-in MAME font onto an element in a layout. This
can be used for basic lamps and built-in layouts. See maxaflex.c for
an example. [Aaron Giles]

Added new layout element component type "led7seg", which constructs
a 7-segment LED in an element in a layout. This is commonly used for
external score and timer displays. See maxaflex.c for an example.
[Aaron Giles]

Added built-in layouts for Turbo, Subroc 3D, Buck Rogers, Atari
Football, Atari Baseball, and Super Speed Racer using the new 
primitives. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed overflow computation in the S2650 core. [Aaron Giles]

More Sega G-80 raster cleanup: [Aaron Giles]
 * consolidated the video hardware implementations
 * fixed cocktail mode video and controls in all games
 * fixed Monster Bash (2 board version) video
 * revived Sindbad Mystery and fixed sound chip frequencies

Improved DIP switches in benberob. [Brian Troha]

Added support for real Bubble Bobble MCU. [Trinity, Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed track lookup implementation in Virtua Racing, bringing the
game much closer to playable. [Olivier Galibert]

Minor cleanup and speed hack removal in the konamigx.c [R. Belmont]

Improved magicfly driver. All graphics are properly decoded / banked 
now. [Roberto Fresca]

More improvements to the 6840 timer module. Updated the MPU4 driver
to the most recent implementation. Convert Cosmic Chasm over to
using the new system. [El Condor]

65816/377xx update: [R. Belmont]
 * Made block transfer instructions interruptable as they are on 
    both actual chips (previously a single opcode could eat >400,000 
    cycles with obvious consequences for interrupt timing)
 * M377xx block transfers move one less byte than the 65816, fixed

Adjusted the DAC sound level on the 2612 to something more 
reasonable. [David Haywood]

Taito JC update: [Ville Linde]
 * Some general improvements to the driver
 * Added some more opcodes to the TMS320C51 core

Improved the M2 driver so that the M2 kernel starts to boot, but it 
hangs quite soon due to some multiprocessor issues. [Ville Linde]

Updated several games' input ports to use IPT_BILL1 for bill 
acceptors. [ClawGrip]

Properly documented and connected the MCU code in the Namco System 1,
System 86, Baraduke, Pacland, and Sky Kid drivers. [Brian Troha]

Renamed "Native" views to "Pixel Aspect" views to avoid the confusion
that they are anything but artificial aspect ratios. [Aaron Giles]

Added beam width control to the UI sliders. [Aaron Giles]

More Zaxxon driver cleanups/fixes: [Aaron Giles]
 * fixed sound problems in Razmataz
 * corrected background and sprite positioning
 * fixed bugs introduced in sample handling
 * bootlegs and alternate versions work again
 * added state saving support to the Sega universal sound board

Added several common generic graphics layouts to vidhrdw/generic.c, 
for use by multiple drivers. [Aaron Giles]

Added new option -video none which can be used for CPU benchmarking
without the overhead of the video system. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed remaining crashes in GDI/ddraw mode when drawing vector games.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed the -artwork option to avoid confusion. If you want to run
without any artwork, use -view standard instead. [Aaron Giles]

Added options -screen, -aspect, -resolution, and -view which apply
to all windows. These values can be individually overridden for each
specific window by using the existing -screen<n>, -aspect<n>,
-resolution<n>, and -view<n> options. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug that caused the sound sampling code to not track changes in
the refresh rate. [Aaron Giles]

Began cleanup/rewrite of the Sega G-80 raster games. This is still
very much a WIP, so don't report any bugs: [Aaron Giles]
 * cleaned up input port handling similar to the G-80 vectors
 * proper clock and video speeds
 * reimplemented Space Odyssey background including collision detect
 * fully implemented Pig Newton background
 * connected 2-board Monster Bash more correctly

Added new macro PORT_SERVICE_DIPLOC for specifying a PORT_SERVICE
and a DIPLOCATION. [Aaron Giles]

Massive cleanup/fixing of 16-bit Sega drivers: [AWJ]
 * many corrections to descriptive set names, adding revision letters,
    cabinet types, etc.
 * fixed many DIP switches and added PORT_DIPLOCATION support
 * adjusted min/max values for analog controls to improve response
 * fixed button ordering between System 16A/B
 * cleaned up a number of ROM names and fixed some incorrect guesses
 * some cleanup of turbo.c as well
 * fixed visible area in Hang-On hardware
 * actually disabling 8751 in games that have a fake replacement
 * hooked up 8255 PPI correctly now that it has mode 2 support
 * fixed behavior of NMI line in later sega sound boards
 * fixed addressing in the SegaPCM sound system
 * some hardware/documentation cleanup

Some cleanups in the new UI/video code to make MESS happy.
[Nathan Woods]

Added macros to prevent use of strcasecmp and strncasecmp for
better cross-platform compatibility. [Nathan Woods]

Connected unimplemented opcode $01 on the 6809 core. [Antoine Mine]

Implemented CNT pin and some serial features of the 6526 CIA chip.
[Nathan Woods]

Mapped service button in slammast. [Canim]

Fixed bug in 8039 CPU handling of A11 latch. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote Zaxxon driver from the schematics. This is still a WIP (not
finished yet): [Aaron Giles]
 * correct clock speeds and video timing
 * complete memory maps
 * connected universal sound board to Ixion and Razmataz
 * simplified video code and merged common cases together
 * palette derived from resistor weights
 * background positioning still a little off

Added service_coin_lockout_w() to lockout service coins. [Aaron Giles]

Added MDRV_SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS() which lets you specify a pixel clock,
horizontal, and vertical video timing values in place of the usual
screen size, visible area, refresh rate, and VBLANK timing values.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug that prevented save/restore from working in the UI.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed mode selection logic so that refresh is weighted more strongly
when picking a mode. This allows you to specify -resolution 0x0@60 to
force MAME to pick a 60Hz screen refresh while allowing it to choose
the best resolution. [Aaron Giles]

Removed hard core dependency on samples. [Andrew Gardner]

Added what seems to be a proper fix for the background transparency 
flag that was needed by champbwl to show the green background.
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Updates to the MagicFly driver: [Robert Fresca]
 - Figured out the MC6845 (mapped at $0800-$0801)
 - Fixed the screen size based on MC6845 registers.
 - Fixed the visible area based on MC6845 registers.
 - Corrected the gfx rom region.
 - Solved the NMI/vblank issue. Now attract works.
 - Changed CPU clock to 625khz.
 - Added new findings to the technical notes.
 - Marked magicfly PAL as NO_DUMP (read protected).

Fixed memory write ordering bug in the 68000 core. [Charles MacDonald]

Added some PPC602 specific opcodes and registers. [Ville Linde]

Removed NEW_RENDER definition and all support for the old rendering
system from the core. Cleaned up a bunch of useless and deprecated
code as a result. [Aaron Giles]

Massively rewrote the user interface to rely on the new rendering
systems. Broke the UI into multiple pieces (ui.c, uimenu.c, uigfx.c).
The code is now verging on readable. [Aaron Giles]

Renamed ui_popup to popmessage across the code, and implemented
popmessage in mame.c. This breaks the dependency between the core 
driver code and the user interface in almost all cases. [Aaron Giles]

Added a red background to serious warning messages in the vain hope
that people might take better notice. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed vector game crashes with DirectDraw rendering. [Aaron Giles]

Consolidated live screen parameters into a screen_state structure.
Machine->visible_area[num] is now Machine->screen[num].visarea.
Machine->refresh_rate[num] is now Machine->screen[num].refresh.
[Aaron Giles]

Added new function configure_screen() which can control the width,
height, visible area, and refresh rate of each screen. This function
allows for widths and heights larger than what were specified in the
game driver, so you no longer have to specify the maximum width and
height in the driver, but can instead specify a typical width and
height. This function supercedes the old set_visible_area() and
set_refresh_rate() functions. The former has been rewritten to call
configure_screen(), while the latter has been removed entirely.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed the behavior for supporting overscan and other effects. The
width and height of a screen control the overall bitmap size. The
visible area of a screen specify its non-blanked boundaries (and 
default visible area, as before). [Aaron Giles]

Moved line-to-quad conversion routine into the core render.c as
another utility function. [Aaron Giles]

and changed the DIP switches used for protection to real DIP 
switches. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed crash in the PGM driver. [David Haywood]

Properly emulated the sprite overdraw effect in ninjakd2. Now you 
can see the "opening" effect and the previously 2 bugged levels are 
fixed. Converted the driver to use tilemaps as well.
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Additional updates to the magicfly driver. Improved documentation
and input port mapping. [Roberto Fresca]

Fixed gamma and brightness ranges in the UI to match the limits from
the command line. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed default flicker value to 0. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed scrolling in the palette view. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed assertion when the MAME window was minimized. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug that prevented resizing of secondary windows. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote Missile Command driver from schematics: [Aaron Giles]
 * CPU speed now correct (slows down for lower 32 scanlines)
 * proper frame rate and IRQ signal timing
 * service mode works on some sets, fails on others due to 6502 bug
 * accurate bitmap mapping and cycle counts for 3-bit accesses
 * using bitmap access PROM for bit mode writes

Fixed bug that led to black crosshairs in lightgun games.
[Aaron Giles]

Reimplemented the sparkle circuit to bring back stars in Tempest.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed the background brightness in vector games by default. If you
want to see the overlays faintly on vector games, increase the
brightness a bit. [Aaron Giles]

More Crystal Castles tweaks: [Aaron Giles]
 * Connected EAROM correctly (passes POST now)
 * Added a guess for what the "POTATO" chip does. If you're a CC fan
    report to MAMETesters how MAME looks compared to the arcade when 
    the screen scrolls up inbetween level 4 and 5.

Rewrote Cloud 9 driver to mimic the Crystal Castles driver since it
is obviously an early version of the same hardware: [Aaron Giles]
 * Implemented video RAM banking correctly based on tracing out a
    Firebeast PCB, which appears to be identical
 * Traced out color mapping and implemented correctly
 * Reduced EAROM down to 4 bits
 * Fixed DIP switch definitions

across the whole source base. [MASH]

Some graphics improvements to the Magic Fly driver. [Roberto Fresca]

Fixed the fire button INPUT_PORT of player2 in Lethal Enforcers.
[Cananas]

Changed the coordinates where for offscreen lightgun reloading, moving
it from the upper-left to the upper-right for better compatibility.
[Cananas]

Fixed interrupt clearing function in 6840 module. [El Condor]

Added multiple input controls in -listxml output for games with more 
than one type. Added pedal control type. Added more info on analog 
controls as defined in the driver: minimum, maximum, sensitivity, 
keydelta, and reverse. This required the 'control' attribute in the 
XML to be moved into an element. There can now be more than one
'control' element in the input secction. [uRebelScum]

Improved the description of screens in -listxml. Multiple screens
are now listed, each with their own attributes. Rotation is now fully
specified (rather than just vertical/horizontal). The width and 
height now describe the raw game screen before any rotation.
[Krick]

Fixed bug that caused the UI to be impacted by command-line 
brightness, contrast, gamma controls. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug that prevented the contrast from pushing vector games to
their maximum brightness. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote Crystal Castles driver from the schematics: [Aaron Giles]
 * corrected clock speeds and frame rates
 * reimplemented video system to use mixer PROM
 * now using sync PROM to generate interrupts at correct times
 * sync PROM is also used to determine proper visible area and
    VBLANK timings
 * implemented the VRAM write protection by using the WP PROM
 * hooked up second player trackball properly
 * fixed coin counters
 * now computing palette based on resistor weights
 * watchdog is now set for 8 VBLANKs to match the schematics
 * added save state support
 * mapped complete memory space according to schematics

Fixed bug in JED parsing code that would checksum fuses beyond the
number explicitly specified. Some programs write extra fuse data
beyond the end and this should not be part of the checksum. Also made
the checksum parsing more flexible to handle JED files with extra 0
digits in the file checksum. [Aaron Giles]

Removed xml2info utility. The -listinfo format was retired over 2 
years ago. It is time to move on. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the core makefile to put back specific rules for building
EXEs to promote more commonality with platforms that don't put an
extension on executable files. [Aaron Giles]

Added gapless variants to the dual and triple screen layouts.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed 1 pixel border now that the Direct3D code is properly setting
texture clamping. This should get rid of the gaps in the Darius
layout, which were caused by bilinear filtering the last pixel on the
screen with the black pixel border. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed -effect none to longer produce an error message. [Aaron Giles]

Removed the VIDEO_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO_* flags for drivers. These flags
were used inconsistently, and can be effectively computed if 
necessary from the screen width/height and orientation. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the on screen display so that pressing ENTER resets a value
to its default. [Aaron Giles]

Moved all options to a single central location in windows/config.c.
Cleaned up and reordered the options more logically. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote windows.txt to reflect all of the new options and to update
the behavior of existing options to match the current implementation.

Source Changes
--------------

Changed XML output so that BIOS sets, ROM sets, and disks are output
in the defined order. [MadSkunk]

Fixed a couple of bugs in the new screenshot taking code.
[Nathan Woods]

Improved memory map and clock speeds for the MPU4 driver. [El Condor]

Moved clipping into the core, rather than relying on the OSD layer to
do the work. Removed the PUSH_CLIP and POP_CLIP primitives as they
are no longer necessary. Added U/V coordinates to the primitives.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed the rendering order so that overlays mixed with backdrops work
as expected. Note that over-rendering backdrop pieces (like gollygho
does) may not be supported in the future. [Aaron Giles]

Changed DirectDraw behavior so that it will render to an offscreen
system memory buffer if any blending is required, thus providing
access to all the effects with a bit of slowdown in those cases.
[Aaron Giles]

Added a new command line option: -effect <filename>, which specifies
a PNG file that is loaded and used as an RGB multiply overlay. This
allows for scanline and RGB aperture mask effects. These overlays
rotate with the game screens and only affect the game screens, not
any of the other artwork. They also only run at the raw resolution
of the render_target. This means in Direct3D or GDI modes, they
map 1:1 to the pixels on your screen. In DirectDraw mode, they map
1:1 to the source pixels of the image (for DirectDraw, you can use
-prescale n if you want an n:1 mapping; for example, you would
probably want -prescale 2 if using a 2-pixel-tall scanlines overlay).
[Aaron Giles]

Added brightness, contrast, and gamma controls per-screen in the
on-screen display section of the UI. This requires a change to the
OSD rendering code to use lookup tables when copying RGB data to
textures. Default values can be specified via the -brightness,
-contrast, and -gamma command line/configuration options. Note that
these options only affect screen areas of the final output and have
no effect on artwork or the UI. The values configured in the OSD are
saved in the config file for each game. [Aaron Giles]

Added full screen equivalents of the brightness, contrast, and gamma
controls. Unlike the screens-specific options, these only work in
full screen mode using DirectX, and apply globally, affecting 
artwork and user interface as well. They are controlled via the
-full_screen_brightness, -full_screen_contrast, and 
-full_screen_gamma options. [Aaron Giles]

Added generic pen changing notification callbacks to the palette
system. [Aaron Giles]

Removed vector intensity controls as they are redundant with the new
contrast controls. [Aaron Giles]

Added X and Y offset/scale controls for each screen. This allows you
to control the actual position of the screen within its container. In
order to see beyond the game-configured visible area, the game must
have set up the screen size to be larger than the core visible area.
The Williams drivers have been updated as an example. Eugene Jarvis
mentioned that if you adjust your monitor, you can see the stack in
Robotron off to the right, and now you can in MAME as well. The values 
configured in the OSD are saved in the config file for each game.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed logic so that no rendering apart from the UI happens before
MAME is in a running state. Until that time, a single pixel border
will be displayed around the edges of each screen. [Aaron Giles]

Added option_get_int_range() and option_get_float_range() functions
which do added range checking on parameters, rather than requiring 
the callers to do the work. Also changed the behavior on options
parsing failure to set to the default value rather than defaulting
to 0. [Aaron Giles]

Changed behavior of secondary windows so that they are not created
as children of the primary window. Please re-verify that multiple
screens still work with this change on your setup. [Aaron Giles]

Added new video option to move the user interface to secondary 
screens. The selected screen is saved in the video configuration.

Fixed Address Error in Grand Cross Pinball (it's caused by the 
sound IRQ..but the music player was ripped out by Aaron ages ago, 
related?)  I've disabled the IRQ rather for now rather than making 
a new sound core. [David Haywood]

Fixed crash in debug builds running the Deco MLC games.
[David Haywood]

Updated the Tecmo Bowl, Gaelco 2, X-Men 6p, and Megatech drivers to 
support dual screens. [David Haywood]

Changed VIDEO_UPDATE to return a set of flags. Only one flag is
currently defined, indicating that video has not changed at all
since the previous update. Most drivers should just return 0.
[Nathan Woods]

Changed the MSM5205 ADPCM decoder to no longer perform bounds 
checking to prevent the signal from overflowing. The MSM5205 data 
sheet clearly states that this isn't the case, and there is no 
overflow protection in the chip. Also, the chip's internal DA 
converter is just 10-bit, even if the processed signal is 12-bit.

Sega Model 2 driver update: [Ville Linde]
 - i960 bugfixes
 - SHARC improvements and bugfixes
 - Added HLE of the geometry DSP for now
 - Moved video hardware emulation to vidhrdw/model2.c and added 
    preliminary 3D graphics emulation

Taito JC driver update: [Ville Linde]
 - Improved M68040 FPU emulation
 - Improved the TMS320C51 core
 - Added 2D graphics emulation
 - Added inputs to all games
 - Properly hooked up sounds in all games

Added "fast forward" function (defaults to the INSERT key). While
holding this key down, the frameskip is temporarily maxed out and
throttling is turned off. This is useful for skipping over parts of
the emulation. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed some glitchiness in font displaying where they would switch in
and out of scaled modes due to rounding errors. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up handling of layout dependencies in the makefile.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug when clipping quads in Direct3D mode. [Aaron Giles]

Flipped Punchout and Playchoice drivers so that screen 0 is the 
"main" screen. [Aaron Giles]

Added "left half" and "right half" to the Darius layouts so you can
stretch three screens over two, though you need to explicitly set 
them either in the UI or using the -view0 and -view1 parameters on
the command line. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the initial UI screens to only compute their text a single
time. This reduces the CPU usage greatly when displaying some of the
"game doesn't work" warnings. [Aaron Giles]

Added support for pausing/unpausing while showing graphics and 
tilemaps. [Aaron Giles]

Added get/set calls to control layers on a per-target basis. This
allows for dynamic control of visibility of artwork layers and the
option to crop to the screen. Added menu items to control these
options. [Aaron Giles]

Removed options.use_artwork from the global options. This is now
directly configured by the OSD layer. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed edge case where the extra pixel on non-wrapping textures would
sometimes lead to exceeding the maximum texture size. [Aaron Giles]

Added concept of maximum texture size to the core renderer to prevent
giant textures from being requested if the OSD layer can't handle
them. [Aaron Giles]

MAMETesters bugs fixed (there are probably more)
-----------------------
listxmlvaridation0106u7ora [Aaron Giles, VGR]

Source Changes
--------------

Changed -listxml to accept a wildcard gamename like most other
frontend options to limit which games are output.
[Aaron Giles, Buddabing]

More generic 6840 module improvements. [El Condor]

Moved MESS-specific Atari FDC code into a MESS specific file, in 
addition to fixing bugs. [Nathan Woods]

Updated the Psikyo4 and Backfire drivers to support multiple 
screens. [David Haywood]

Moved some common code into taito_en.c (taito ensoniq sound system).
[David Haywood]

Added 16-bit color support for the DirectDraw renderer (only used if
switchres is off or in a window). Fixed 16-bit line rendering in the
software rasterizer. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed ddraw bug where switching views sometimes didn't clear out the
edges of the screen. [Aaron Giles]

The UI is now limited to a single screen. [Aaron Giles]

Reimplemented the palette/graphics/tilemap viewer. It is still 
connected to F4, but works differently. To switch between modes,
press the ENTER key. Here are the new keys in each mode:

 * Palette/colortable mode:
    [ ] - switch between palette and colortable modes
    up/down - scroll up/down one line at a time
    pgup/pgdn - scroll up/down one page at a time
    home/end - move to top/bottom of list
    enter - switch to graphics viewer

 * Graphics mode:
    [ ] - switch between different graphics sets
    up/down - scroll up/down one line at a time
    pgup/pgdn - scroll up/down one page at a time
    home/end - move to top/bottom of list
    left/right - change color displayed
    r - rotate tiles 90 degrees clockwise
    - + - increase/decrease the number of tiles displayed per row
    enter - switch to tilemap viewer

 * Tilemap mode:
    [ ] - switch between different tilemaps
    up/down/left/right - scroll 8 pixels at a time
    shift+up/down/left/right - scroll 1 pixel at a time
    control+up/down/left/right - scroll 64 pixels at a time
    r - rotate tilemap view 90 degrees clockwise
    - + - increase/decrease the zoom factor
    enter - switch to palette/colortable mode

Note that both graphics and tilemap modes only display data at an
integral scale factor so you are limited based on the resolution of
your render target. For -video ddraw, you can get more pixels by
using -prescale to scale the screen. For -video d3d, the render
target is at your screen's native resolution already. [Aaron Giles]    

Improved scaling calculations when running with -video ddraw and no
hardware stretch to better approximate the real aspect ratio.
[Aaron Giles]

Added more internal texture reference tracking to ensure that stale
data is not being referenced if the OSD layer holds onto a render
list. [Aaron Giles]

Moved cygwin-specific compiler options to windows.mak. [Aaron Giles]

Removed screen aspect ratio specification from the machine driver.
This information is now provided by the render/view system. Games
with odd aspect ratios should include a game-specific layout to
position the screens. [Aaron Giles]

Screenshots are now properly rotated again. Also, MAME now saves one
screenshot per visible screen for multi-screen games (i.e., cyberbal 
will write two PNGs per snapshot taken if both screens are visible).
[Aaron Giles]

Changed the way built-in layouts are handled. There is now a new
layout directory in the source which contains actual .lay files.
These are converted at compile time into .lh files which are 
#included by various drivers and then referenced. The built-in set
of horizontal, vertical, and dual screen layouts are also handled
this way now instead of being dynamically generated. In order to
support things like "native" aspect ratios, a limited form of 
variable substitution is now done on most of the XML attributes when
they are read. [Aaron Giles]

Improved default layout selection. For multiscreen games on a single
monitor, the default layout will show all screens at the same time.
For multiscreen games on multiple monitors, the default layouts will
select one screen per game. [Aaron Giles]

Converted the punchout driver to a proper dual screen game. Rewrote
the video portion to use tilemaps. [Aaron Giles]

Added dual screen support to the PlayChoice 10 and vsnes drivers.
[Aaron Giles]

Added MDRV_DEFAULT_LAYOUT to specify a default layout at the machine
driver level. [Aaron Giles]

Added triple screen support to the Darius and Ninja Warriors drivers,
and dual screen support to the Warrior Blade driver. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed palette for games which were using palette_set_brightness.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed logic so that trying to run more screens than you physically
have in full screen mode will just display as many as will fit rather
than fighting to put multiple full screen displays on a single
monitor. [Aaron Giles]

Added optimizations to figure out the minimal set of screen areas
to clear, even with complicated views and multiple screens. 
[Aaron Giles]

--------------

Improvements to the Sang Ho driver, making them somewhat playable.
[David Haywood, Tomasz Slanina]

Fixed off-by-one drawing error in the Pasha Pasha 2 driver.
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed some instruction forms in the 6309 diassembler to consume
the correct number of bytes. [Nicola Salmoria]

Added back support for DirectDraw. Unlike the old support, this 
requires DirectX 7 or later. There is now a new option to control
what video system is being used for rendering. Use -video d3d to use
Direct3D. Use -video ddraw to use DirectDraw. And use -video gdi to
force the use of GDI for rendering. Also added back the -hwstretch
option to control whether or not DirectDraw does stretching. Added
support for the -prescale option when using DirectDraw as well. It
should also work ok with multiple screens. [Aaron Giles]

Added a compile-time option to rendersw.c to prevent reads from the
destination. This removes the ability to do a number of blends and
effects, but allows you to point the software renderer at a video
memory target and not kill performance. It also improves performance
of software rendering in general by avoiding expensive alpha blending
operations. [Aaron Giles]

Improved font logic so that small fonts are scaled more appropriately
at low resolutions. It's not perfect, but works well for most games
when running with the new DirectDraw option, which always renders
games at minimum resolution. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug that messed up partial updating. Hopefully it all should be
back to normal again. [Aaron Giles]

--------------

Minor fix for x64 compilation support with MSVC. [Malice]

Updated astdelux and omegrace built-in overlays for the new render
system.

Fixed inputs in the mcr68 drivers. [Peale]

Fixed new debugger support for custom register lists.
[Tim Schuerewegen]

Added workaround to make the V60 core work properly on GCC 4.x 
(tested on 4.1.1). [R. Belmont]

Fixed the drc blitters better. [Olivier Galibert]

Improvements to Polygonet Commanders: [R. Belmont]
 * Fixed Z80 IRQ/NMIs to go to the right CPU again
 * Modernized memory map
 * Added network status bit, so the initial test passes well enough 
    to make the DSP56k crash on unimplemented opcodes

Miscellaneous cleanups to the Atari/Max-A-Flex driver, attempting to 
modernize it. [Nathan Woods]

Updated Sega multi-32 driver to support multiple screens. 
[Aaron Giles]

Backed off of the multithreading for the moment in order to focus on
getting the rest of the kinks out of the new renderer. All the
infrastructure is still in place and can be re-enabled by flipping
the ENABLE_THREADS flag in window.c. [Aaron Giles]

Added support for "stretch to fit" when configuring a render target.
Added back the "-keepaspect" option as a result. [Aaron Giles]

Added clamping to the prescale effect so that it doesn't try to 
create excessively large textures. Explicitly reset render states so
that the prescale step is not filtered. Fixed StretchRect usage so
that it doesn't filter on some video cards. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed behavior of pixel aspect ratio when configuring render targets
(was correcting in the wrong direction). [Aaron Giles]

Moved thread priority logic out of ticker.c and into winmain.c where
it really belongs. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up decocass driver: [Juergen Buchmueller]
 - All hardcoded tables are gone now
 - cexplore.pro 32 byte PROM reverse engineered

Fixed windows.mak to support 64-bit builds. [Malice]

Fixed bug where the gamename was reallocated out from under us by
the new config system. [Nathan Woods]

Added the ability to specify a callback when a given option is 
parsed.  This is used on the MESS side to add system-specific
command line options. [Nathan Woods]

More generic 6840 improvements. [El Condor]

Some improvements to the Pasha Pasha 2 driver. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added experimental OSD locks: [Aaron Giles]
 - osd_lock_alloc() allocates a lock
 - osd_lock_acquire() acquires a lock, blocking until success
 - osd_lock_try() tries to acquire a lock and returns whether or
    not it succeeded
 - osd_lock_release() releases a lock
 - osd_lock_free() frees memory used by a lock
If the OSD layer is not using multiple threads, these can just be
stubbed out (return TRUE for osd_lock_acquire and fake the rest).

Fixed ESC key not cancelling out of initial UI screens. [Aaron Giles]

More rendering changes/fixes: [Aaron Giles]
 - Added new render_view_item_get_state() function to return the
    state of a given item
 - Changed render_target_get_primitives to return a new structure
    render_primitive_list, which contains the list of primitives
    along with an osd_lock which must be held while the list is
    being traversed
 - Added "Rotate View" option to the video menu for dynamic in-game
    rotation
 - Moved window creation and management to a separate thread; this
    means all software rendering and all Direct3D calls are done on
    a separate thread from the main game, and will take advantage of
    multiple CPUs/dual cores
 - Changed throttling behavior to skip rendering if we are already
    pending; this makes for a better "fast forward" effect
 - Added -prescale option to pre-scale the game bitmaps before
    rendering to the screen; this helps get rid of the "fuzzy" look
    when running with -filter enabled, at the expense of some speed.
    Note that only integral values are currently supported (no "auto")

Fixed crash when passing an invalid driver name on the command line.
Centralized the approximate matching logic into driver.c so other
ports can use it as well. [Aaron Giles]

Now properly extracting path from driver name and adding it to the
rompath so that drag & drop of ZIP files works once again.
[Aaron Giles]

More renderer updates: [Aaron Giles]
 - Fixed feature detection bug that led to false-positive warnings
    when starting up
 - Removed extra vertex padding since some graphics cards could not
    cope with it
 - Added shims to support both Direct3D 9 and Direct3D 8; D3D9 is
    the default, with an automatic fallback to d3d8 if not available
 - New option -d3dversion can be used to specify preferred version
    for testing
 - Added 1 pixel black border around all textures to ensure filtering
    on some cards doesn't result in garbage at the edge of the screen
 - Enabled "do not wait" feature when unthrottled and using D3D9; this
    greatly speeds up unthrottled games, but seems to only work in 
    full screen mode
 - Switched from triangle fans to triangle strips
 - Ensured that render states are only being set minimally
 - Added code to reset the device if lost, allowing application 
    switching out of full screen mode and fixing multi-monitor mode
    with resolution switching

Added new function verbose_printf() which is used instead of checking
the verbose global to print information to the screen. Changed all
locations that were checking the global to use this new function.

WARNING: As of this build, the new rendering system is enabled by
default. The primary focus at this point is compatibility, not
performance. Compared to the old -ddraw system, it will appear
slower when fully unthrottled because there is not a good mechanism
to skip the render if the graphics hardware is still busy like we
used to do. If you have any trouble getting a correct display or
if you get warning messages printed out when starting MAME, please
post about them on http://mametesters.org.

SECONDARY WARNING: The command line and INI parsing code was
rewritten. If you notice any problems with handling of parameters
in either case, please report the bugs on http://mametesters.org.

etc into a separate module, restrack.c. [Nathan Woods]

Moved large stack buffers into heap buffers to work better on systems
with small stacks. [Lawrence Gold]

Fixed a subtle auditing issue when both parents and clones had
NO_DUMP ROMs in their manifests. [Hobbes@Play]

Tweaks to the MSVC compiler support: [AtariAce]
 - Removed _MSC_VER specific #pragmas in nec.c
 - Removed _MSC_VER specific #include <malloc.h> in winprefix.h
 - Changed makefile to bootstrap vconv.exe with cl instead of gcc
 - Changed calls to lib to use link /lib instead
 - Updated vconv to only use /arch:SSE2 for VC71 and later
 - Cleaned up the profiler code in winmain.c
 - Removed the direct dependency of MAME on shell32 has been 
 - Tweaked a couple of preprocessor definitions so we compile as far

[Aaron Giles]

Removed remaining chunks of x86 assembly code, as well as references
to NASM in the makefiles. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote the options parsing code to be more flexible and generic.
A new core source file options.c provides the ability to add and
maintain a database of key/value pairs, which can be queried at
runtime. Reconnected all existing frontend options through this code. 
Bounds checking on options for the old renderer is pretty loose, and 
several more complicated options have been disconnected as a result. 
If you are still running with the old renderer, be careful.
[Aaron Giles]

Reorganized fronthlp.c to be one step closer to universal. One more
layer of abstraction and hopefully it will be able to move up into
the core. [Aaron Giles]

New options to control multiple screens in the new renderer:
[Aaron Giles]
 -numscreens specifies how many windows to create
 -screen0/screen1/... specifies the name of the screen for each window
 -resolution0/resolution1/... specifies resolution for each window
 -aspect0/aspect1/... specifies aspect ratio for each screen
 -view0/view1/... specifies starting view for each screen

Deprecated osd_skip_this_frame() with the new renderer. osd_update()
now returns TRUE if it wants to skip the following frame. [Aaron Giles]

Fixes to the new rendering system: [Aaron Giles]
 - Enabled new renderer by default
 - Fixed crash at startup due to uninitialized memory
 - Fixed crash at shutdown due to incorrect shutdown order
 - Fixed rendering of 15-bit direct RGB games
 - Fixed weird frameskipping issues
 - Fixed off-by-one error on visible area

 - Brought software-only case up to support all major blending types
 - Added support for -filter option
 - Reconnected snapshots, though they are unrotated and screen 0 only
 - Fixed several UI problems with new video options menu
 - More strongly defined the blending modes to produce correct effects
 - Added a flag to indicate textures that are of screen bitmaps

IMPORTANT NOTE: The video system in this version has been completely
upended and redesigned. The old video system is still the default;
however, some features may be broken. These are not bug-worthy
reports, as the old system will soon be deprecated. The new system
can be compiled by setting the NEW_RENDER flag on in the makefile.

THE NEW SYSTEM IS STILL WORK-IN-PROGRESS! Apart from video card-
related issues (like it doesn't work on particular hardware or has
an incorrect display), bugs are not being tracked at this time.
There is already a laundry list of things that are broken at the
top of render.c, and there are many other things that still need
to be looked at.

In order to run the new video system with hardware acceleration, 
your machine will require DirectX 8 or later.

--------------

Added support for circular buffering in the SHARC core, and fixed
several minor bugs. [Ville Linde]

Added color PROM support for Nintendo's Sheriff driver. 
[Stefan Jokisch]

Discrete sound updates: [Derrick Renaud]
 - Typedef'ed external discrete sound structures to follow current 
     structure use. Statically defined their use in most drivers to 
     stop name pollution.
 - Created new DISCRETE_555_VCO1 module.  This is the 555&Op-amp 
    oscillator circuit used by Borderline.

Added the new video rendering system. A new file render.c contains
the bulk of the logic. Major changes include: [Aaron Giles]
 - The OSD layer is now responsible for allocating one or more 
    render_targets at osd_init time. The old osd_create_display 
    and osd_close_display calls are not used with the new system, 
    so initialization must take place at osd_init time.
 - The old osd_update_video_and_audio call has now been replaced 
    with a simple osd_update call. This update call passes a 
    mame_time to the OSD layer, which is the current emulated time. 
    Throttling and speed calculations should use this time instead
    of the framerate.
 - osd_update is responsible for calling the render system to 
    request a list of primitives to be drawn on each render_target
    for the current frame. The primitives are simple and include
    clipping rectangles, lines, and rectilinear quads only.
 - If it wishes, the OSD layer can call back to a software
    rasterizer in MAME. The rasterizer code is provided as an
    include module so it can be tuned and optimized for platform-
    specific video modes. See windows/rendsoft.c for a usage
    example.
 - There is a new layout file format .lay, which is XML-based and
    which replaces the old .art files. The .lay files describe how
    to render to a render_target. Each layout file can contain
    multiple "views", which describe one of many ways the various
    elements can be drawn. These views can be selected at runtime
    via the new "Video Options" menu.
 - The built-in UI font can be overridden with any .BDF font. Simply
    name the .BDF file "ui.bdf" and place it in the MAME directory.
    If you run at decent resolutions, you should choose a large 
    point size for this font so that the scaled results look nice.
 - The windows implementation uses Direct3D 8 as the preferred
    mechanism for rendering. By default, it will render at the
    current resolution, rather than switching resolutions as before.
    This can be changed by adding -switchres to the command line.
 - There are still a number of imperfect/incomplete features with
    the new renderer, which is why it is not on by default. An
    incomplete list is given in render.c.

Updates to the taito_x driver: [AWJ]
 - fixed sound problems in twinhawk
 - fixed a couple of dipswitch mistakes introduced recently
 - added PORT_DIPLOCATIONs for superman and twinhawk

Improved MSVC compiler support: [Nathan Woods]
 - modified vconv to support multiple versions of MSVC based on 
    version info
 - added support for more parameter translations
 - makefile now displays compiling and linking messages when
    building vconv

Converted the Windows blitters to use the DRC engine for 
generation. RGB effects are officially broken with this change.
[Nathan Woods]

Fixed a bug that caused a crash when the -debugscript command line 
option was used with an invalid filename. [Nathan Woods]

Corrected the ordering of the DIP_PORTLOCATION() macros to be
consistent. Multi-bit DIP switches should be specified in LSB-
first order. Added a comment to this effect in inptport.h.
[AWJ, Aaron Giles]

Fixed background color in the Deco cassette games.
[Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed potential crash in the micro3d driver. [MamePlus!]

Improvements to CHD-CD support: [R. Belmont]
 - additional RAW CD sector conversion support, so a game can request 
    e.g. 2048-byte data sectors from a RAW CHD-CD and still get the 
    right data
- reversed CHDMAN error message - now non-RAW CHD-CDs are deprecated
- susume now uses a RAW CHD-CD read directly from an original pressed 
   Konami disc

Some improvements to the Polygonet Commanders driver: [Andrew Gardner]
 - adds change_PC() calls to the dsp56k core
 - removed hacky dsp56k initialization, enabling, and disabling
 - added preliminary implementation of banking hardware tied to the 
    dsp56k in Polygonet Commanders

Fixed MSB accesses and latch reading in the 6840 emulator. [El Condor]

Improved N64 audio output: [R. Belmont]
 - rewrote Audio Interface as a stereo DMADAC (which it actually is), 
    greatly simplifying the code along the way
 - fixed AI interrupt semantics

Changed a number of games that were incorrectly using IPT_LIGHTGUN
to use IPT_AD_STICK instead. [Aaron Giles]

Some preparations for proper multiple screen support. The 
visible_area and refresh_rate values in the Machine structure are
now defined as arrays (1 per screen). The machine_config structure
has been altered as well, removing the following fields:

   frames_per_second
   aspect_x, aspect_y
   screen_width, screen_height
   default_visible_area
   vblank_duration

These are all stored per-screen in a new screen_config structure.

Source Changes
--------------

Cleaned up the freekick.c driver [Sonikos]:
 - added 2nd button in gigas/gias2m/oigas
 - matched the Z80 chip mhz to the "confirmed" mhz of gigas

Extended the gfxlayout structure to support "extended" arrays of
x and y offsets. These are used for layouts that are larger than
32x32. This enables the standard structure to be smaller for the
vast majority of games that don't require huge graphics decodes.
The end result is that the MAME .exe is ~3MB smaller.
[Atari Ace, Aaron Giles]

Added some Amiga enhancements needed for MESS Amiga and CDTV 
drivers. [Dirk Best]

Removed non-existant 3rd & 4th player controls from deadconx.
[Don Maeby]

Improvements to the MACS driver: [Tomasz Slanina]
 - fixed a couple of gfx bugs in st0016 video emulation
 - added hacks to allow MACS games to boot
 - removed REGION_DISPOSE flag from srmp5 and speaglsht (no more 
    crashes)

Fixed/improved DIP switches in the powerbal.c, konamigx.c, and 
gsword.c drivers. [Twisty]

More improvements to the BFM driver and the 6840 timer emulation.
[El Condor]

Improvements to the x86 drc engine and the Windows blitters:
 - Blitter CPUID features now accessed by drc_x86_get_features() call
 - Added win_blit_init(), to initialize the blitter
 - Changes to DRC to support usage for things other than CPU cores
 - Fixed drc_dasm() so it works once again
 - Added macros for a number of MMX/SSE instructions
 - Added a number of MMX/SSE instructions to the i386 disassembler

Actually applied the Marine Date fixes which were mentioned in a
previous u release. [Aaron Giles]

Added experimental support for building using Visual C++ 2003/2005.
To do this, you still need the mingw environment (ironically) because
we rely on the mingw make system to call out to the MSVC compilers.
Set the variable MSVC_BUILD=1 on the command line or by modifying
windows.mak, and it will build using the Microsoft compilers. This
works through the use of a stub program vconv.exe which translates
gcc options into MSVC options. As a bootstrapping measure, vconv.exe
is compiled at the start of a clean build by mingw. Most of the
standard build options just work (SYMBOLS, MAP, DEBUG, etc). If you
have a beefy computer, you can also set MAXOPT=1 and use link-time
code generation for maximum optimization effect. :) [Aaron Giles]

Added preliminary support for 64-bit targets. A new makefile define
PTR64 should be set if you are compiling for a 64-bit target. This
propogates a PTR64 define into the C files as well. Made the makefile
smart enough to auto-disable the drc cores for 64-bit, and removed
most of the roadblocks to a 64-bit build, apart from the assembly
blitters, which are currently undergoing a rewrite. [Aaron Giles]

drivers. [Twisty]

Fixed some DIP switches and added controls for 2nd player in cocktail 
mode in Lost Castle in Darkmist. [Sonikos]

Fixed a number of issues in the Windows rendering code:
[Giuseppe Gorgoglione]
 * fixed blit_vectors so it used the dirty pixel array in D3D mode
 * fixed blit_vectors rotation issue for dirty pixels as well
 * changed -full_screen_brightness to -full_screen_gamma
    (which is a more correct description)
 * changed -d3dfilter to be a boolean, since the other filtering modes
    are either obsolete or not applicable to MAME
 * removed limitations on windowing position so you no longer need to
    be aligned on an 8-pixel boundary
 * cleaned up a number of unused global variables
 * improved multi-monitor support to work in GDI mode as well as in
    non-full-screen modes
 * added missing documentation for the -screen parameter

Fixed some remaining errors and inconsistencies in the content and 
usage of MAME header files by comparing declarations against actual
definitions. Removed many orphaned/duplicate declarations. Added
#includes where appropriate, and moved a few declarations to another
file when they were in the wrong location. [Atari Ace]

Removed a number of unused ROM regions. Most (but not all) of the
empty ROM region warnings are now taken care of. Also uncommented/
added missing undumped ROMs/XORs in the Namco and CPS2 games.
[Aaron Giles]

-----------------------
metmqstr0105yel [Aaron Giles]


Source Changes
--------------

Cleaned up the usage of includes/*.h files across the project, by
ensuring that:
 1. All includes/foo.h files are annotated with comments describing 
     the source of the declarations.
 2. Each source file so annotated also explicitly does an
     #include "includes/foo.h" to ensure consistent definitions.
Along the way a number of inconsistent, irrelevant, and incomplete
declarations were removed/cleaned up. [Atari Ace]

Moved calls to ui_set_visible_area() into set_visible_area() to work
around timing problems when they are called at separate times during
a single frame. [Nathan Woods]

Updated CPS driver to more accurately draw tilemaps, based on
evidence from a board with mixed ROMs. [David Haywood]

Fixed crash bug in old debugger introduced in the last release.
[Olivier Galibert]

Added demo sounds DIP switch to Pig Newton. [Derrick Renaud]

Fixed DIP switches in gunmast, batlbubl. [Brian Troha]

Added simulated sound for tumbleb2 and pangpang. [David Haywood]

Added accessors for the CA2, CB2 and IRQ signals on the 6821 PIA.
[Nathan Woods]

Accurate C-Chip emulation in Bonze Adventure to fix protection 
problems (no more missing or made up data, all data extracted from 
working pcb). [Bryan McPhail]

Some cleanups to the Taito F3 naming. [Marco, Bryan McPhail]

Fixed the Z80 PIO code to prevent an interrupt to occur between the 
PIO_OP_MODE byte and mask which follows. According to the datasheet, 
this is not permitted in hardware. [Robert]

Added many FPU opcodes to the M68040 core. [Ville Linde]

Fixed rom loading in all Taito JC games. [Ville Linde]

Added TMS320C51 cpu core. [Ville Linde]

Split out some of the Nintendo 64 core pieces into MESS-shareable
modules. [R. Belmont]

Removed hard linkage of game driver clones. This reduces hard 
inter-driver dependencies and allows for easier usage of tiny.mak.
[Atari Ace, Aaron Giles]

Updates to the PGM driver: [El Semi]
 - Corrected mask on sprite width parameter in sprite list
 - Corrected decryption function for The Killing Blade
 - Fixed GFX Rom loading in The Killing Blade
 - Added set The Killing Blade (Taiwan?)
 - Added some WIP protection simulation for The Killing Blade
    (Taiwan?), game boots but at least one stage is broken

Added $(OBJ)/%.s target to the makefile for easy disassembly
analysis of generated code (you can also use the $(OBJ)/%.pp to
examine preprocessor output). [Nathan Woods]

Moved region and address space names out of the Windows-specific
code and into more common locations. [Olivier Galibert]

Fixed a bug with code comments that led to incorrect display for
long comments. [Andrew Gardner]

Added several missing H8 opcodes to the core and color DAC to 
lastfght.c. [Tomasz Slanina]

Changed -romident option so that it returns errorlevels based on how
many ROMs were identified (0=all files identified, 1=all files except
some non-ROM files identified, 2=some files identified, 3=no files
identified). [Aaron Giles]

Added stricter type checking for save state registrations (only works 
in gcc). [Aaron Giles]

Changed automatic ROM assignment logic in the memory system so that
it doesn't auto-assign out-of-bounds ROM regions. [Aaron Giles]

Changed memory save state registration so it doesn't register for
saving memory areas that overlap memory regions. This means that 
drivers which rely on extra memory regions for RAM will need to fix
that before supporting save. [Aaron Giles]

Modified a number of drivers that were using empty RAM regions for
RAM or which had extraneous memory regions. Most significant changes
were to the arcadia, nss, and stv drivers. [Aaron Giles]

Added a warning during validity checks to point out empty memory
regions. These should either be eliminated, or marked with an 
explicit fill value (ROMREGION_ERASE00 or ROMREGION_ERASEFF) to clear
the warnings. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote a large chunk of the Amiga emulation to support sound and
additional video modes/effects including extra half-bright mode, 
manual sprites, and mid-scanline changes. This is still a work
in progress. [Aaron Giles]

NOTICE: The official Windows binaries are no longer compressed with
UPX. This means that when you extract the files, the main MAME .EXE
file will be much larger than you are used to. This is normal. The
code has always been that big. Leaving it uncompressed will allow MAME
to use less memory when run (ironically).

IMPORTANT CHANGES FOR OSD DEVELOPERS: There have been several changes
this cycle that impact you. Please scan this file in detail for the
details.

than one potential output source. Fixed the -oslog option in the
Windows build. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed "do" command in the debugger. [Aaron Giles]

Had to undo the use of timers to trigger save/restore of states. This
leads to one less timer in the system, and hence will break the save
states from previous versions. The current save state system is
extremely sensitive to such changes, unfortunately. This will be
addressed in a future version. [Aaron Giles]

[Tatsuyuki Satoh]

Updated the Dragonball Z games to use the K056832 chip emulation,
fixing color offsets and priorities. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Updated raw mouse support for Windows XP: [Derrick Renaud]
 * Reversed the RAWMOUSE device list. RAWMOUSE reports the last 
    installed mouse as the first device. I now place new mice at the 
    end.
 * Added clipping to RAWMOUSE support so the cursor does not leave 
    the game area in Windowed mode. Also fixed the non-RAWMOUSE 
    Windowed mode clipping I broke by my last changes.
 * You can now see the names of the mice attached by using -verbose.
 * Changed Lightgun functionality if using XP.  You no longer need 
    to use -lightgun or -dual_lightgun. Use -mouse and multiple (2+) 
    "HID-compliant mouse" lightguns will be detected. Lightgun 
    support in Win98/Me remains unchanged. -offscreen_reload can 
    still be used on Win98/Me/XP. See windows.txt for further info.

Fixed indirect palettes in the System 32 driver. This fixes Sonic
graphics finally. [Anonymous]

Fixed window resizing bug when running in a window. [Wilbert Pol]

Switched MDEC decoding input from CbCrY to CrCbY, and switched MDEC 
15bit output from rgb to bgr. [smf]

Removed unnecessary #includes from a number of files. Added #includes
to files that were defining items that were declared in the header. 
Better documented where items are defined in the header files from 
the includes directory. [Atari Ace]

Fixed some crashes in the debugger if you tried to set breakpoints
while the game was running and there was no active CPU. 
[Nathan Woods]

Fixed crash when calling fatalerror before the system was ready for
it. [Nathan Woods]

More improvements to the Sega universal sound board. Star Trek is
almost identical to the samples. Tac/Scan is not that far off, 
surprisingly. [Aaron Giles]

Added new function input_port_set_changed_callback() which lets you
receive a change notification when certain bits in an input port
have changed. See sega.c for an example. [Nathan Woods, Aaron Giles]

Added new PORT_CUSTOM() macro which allows you to specify a callback
to return the value of bits in an input port. This saves you from
needing to intercept the port read and modify the bits there. See
sega.c for an example. [Aaron Giles]

Added new PORT_DIPLOCATION() macro which allows you to specify the
physical PCB location of a DIP switch and the switches that correspond
to the bits in the DIPSETTING. See sega.c for an example.
[Aaron Giles]

Updated the i8039 disassembler to the new interface. [Aaron Giles]

Moved read/write handlers for input ports, watchdog, and interrupt
enable out of the core and into machine/generic.c. Moved generic
palette hanlders out of the core and into vidhrdw/generic.c. Clarified
the names of many of the palette handlers and simplified the code.
[Aaron Giles]

Some improvements to Magical Error. Title and attract works. No 
sound. Hangs in game. Problems with shared mem and main-sub cpu 
communciation. [Tomasz Slanina]

Added validity checks to ensure CPU core completeness. [Nathan Woods]

Major update to the Aleck64 driver. Still not fully working yet.
[Ville Linde]

Fixed comment display for processors which use an ADDRBUS_SHIFT.
[Andrew Gardner]

Added accessors to return output values for the 6821 PIA.

Added oversampling support to the Exidy custom sound and to the DAC
sound system. [Aaron Giles]

Sega vector game updates: [Aaron Giles]
 - Rewrote vector generator from schematics. Yes, it is supposed to
    be that jumpy on zooms!
 - Corrected CPU speeds and cleaned up memory maps.
 - Connected AY-8912 to Zektor for missing sound effects.
 - Added emulation of the Universal Sound Board -- not yet perfected,
    but gets rid of the need for samples in Star Trek and Tac/Scan.
    Tac/Scan sounds pretty wretched now, but Star Trek is close.
 - Fixed CPU clock speed on the speech board, but it appears to be a
    bit too slow now.
 - This is still work-in-progress. Don't report bugs yet.

Source Changes
--------------

Hooked up missing language jumper in the Psikyo 4 games.
[David Haywood]

Added board notes to the Namco System 12 driver, hooked up the light
gun in Ghouls Panic/Point Blank 2, and emulated Tekken Tag Tournament 
DMA protection (still not playable). [Olivier Galibert, Duddie, smf]

Fixed old debugger compilation on non-Windows platforms. Added
mame_strnicmp along the way. [Lawrence Gold]

Fixed compile errors under GCC 4.1. [Lawrence Gold]

Changed the NES PPU interfaces to follow new struct conventions.
[Nathan Woods]

Updated disassembly comments support: [Andrew Gardner]
 - fixed a 0-length comment bug (no more "// 0, " allowed)
 - added comment output to the new debugger's dasm command
 - changed the comment save path from /mame/comment to /mame/comments

Added new debugger properties: logunmap, logunmapd, logunmapi which
enable/disable logging of unmapped memory accesses. [Nathan Woods]

Added save state support to the Astrocade driver. [Adam Bousley]

Some small improvements to the Polygonet Commanders driver.
[Andrew Gardner]

Preliminary Thumb implementation for the ARM7 core. Many opcodes 
present, but there are definite sign problems. [Ryan Holtz]

Hooked up ARM7 protection CPU in KOV2. Boots but does not run or 
play due to the Thumb sign problems. [R. Belmont]

Fixed incorrect flags emulation in the 8080 CMA instruction.
[Kopromaster]

Added support for zero-length palettes (requires RGB direct mode) and
several validity checks related to display variables. [Nathan Woods]

Updated windows input code: [Derrick Renaud]
 * Now using RAWMOUSE mode if available. This means you can now use 
    multiple mice in Windows XP. Lightgun support has not been 
    changed yet.
 * Added back DX7 support for the windows input system to support 
    multiple mice. It was set to DX5 in 104u2.
 * Removed the system mouse from the list of available mice on 
    non-XP systems. This allows you to now properly select the 
    individual mouse.
 * Modified the Analog Axes selection of the player controls to be 
    more responsive.

Cleaned up video system in Scorpion 2 driver. [El Condor]

Converted asterix to use K056832 emulation. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Reduced encryption in Gaelco games down to equations. These still 
need to be optimized, but the giant encryption tables are no longer 
needed. [Nicola Salmoria]

Cleaned up include files in CPU/sound cores. CPU cores should 
generally only need to include cpuintrf.h. Sound cores should
generally only need to include sndintrf.h. [Atari Ace, Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug that caused a full set of validity checks even on release
builds. [Aaron Giles]

New debugger features: [Aaron Giles]
 * new command "print" is a simple way to display the result of one 
    or more expressions
 * new command "symlist" displays all the symbols registered
 * all save state registered scalar globals are now available as
    symbols (prefixed by a '.')
 * all save state registered global arrays are now available for
    viewing/editing in the memory window
 * all registered memory regions are also available for viewing/
    editing in the memory window

Made it a fatal error to request operations on invalid sound/CPU
indexes. These have been logged to the error.log in the past, but
really need to be cleaned up. Added a new function 
safe_activecpu_get_pc() that can be used when logging PCs to smartly
detect whether or not it is safe to call activecpu_get_pc().
[Aaron Giles]

Changed CPU init/reset callbacks. The init callback now accepts a
number of parameters, including the CPU index, the clock, a generic
configuration parameter, and a pointer to the IRQ callback. The reset
callback no longer takes any parameters (the configuration parameter
has been moved to the init callback). And the IRQ_CALLBACK getter/
setter has been removed since this is now set up once at 
initialization time. [Aaron Giles]

Added mame_get_phase to determine which program phase (init/reset/
running/exit) the system is in. This is intended primarily for
assertions to enforce rules about when certain actions can be taken.
[Aaron Giles]

Rewrote winalloc to be more dynamic, and to ignore memory leaks in
the runtime. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed memcards properly. They are no longer hardcoded for the neogeo.
The implementation has moved to generic/machine.c, and a callback
handler very similar to NVRAM is now supported in the machine driver
definition. Cards are created per-game, so the memcard directory now
has a subfolder per game with each game's cards stored underneath.

IMPORTANT CHANGES FOR OSD DEVELOPERS: 

1. osd_pause is no longer called directly. Rather, your osd_init 
function should register the osd_pause callback (if necessary) using 
add_pause_callback.

2. osd_die is now handled by the core; you should remove this
function from the OSD layer.

3. logerror is front-ended in the core; it calls to a new OSD
function osd_logerror which handles the OS-specific file and/or 
debugger logging.

Added "wb+" disposition to osd_tool_fopen. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed cheat timer to fire at the correct rate. Also fixed 
initialization order to work around dependency on the video/UI

Added save states to 3 more drivers: arkanoid.c, system1.c, and
taitosj.c, and to the SN76496 sound chip for system1. [Adam Bousley]

Fixed a couple of small memory leaks and a crash bug found by 
valgrind. [Lawrence Gold]

Added save state support to the tetrisp2 driver. [Nathan Woods]

Added save state support to Cloak and Dagger, Mario Bros, Crazy 
Baloon, and the SN76477 sound chip. [Adam Bousley]

Hooked up the R4650 properly in the MIPS recompiler. [R. Belmont]

 - Many notes added
 - Final Furlong 2 (World and Japan sets) added

Added sanity checking to the set_visible_area() call to ensure it is
not set larger than the screen bitmap. [Nathan Woods]

Added decryption of the BIOS for the Namco System 10 games using MEMN 
ROM boards. [smf]

Changed the ROM banking of the Bellfruit 'Adder' card to the new
standard, as well as tidying up the MPU4 emulation with some new 
information. [El Condor]

A bit more progress on Raiden 2 sprite decryption. [Olivier Galibert]

Added save states to Namco Classics Collection 1 & 2, Taito B System,
and fixed save states in Operation Wolf. [Adam Bousley]

Debugger changes/updates: [Aaron Giles]
 - added new streaming text buffer system
 - rewrote the console window to use the streaming text buffer
 - added new log window (Ctrl+L) which displays live error.log output
 - added disassembly view menu to control comments versus raw or
    encrypted opcodes
 - added disassembly menu to the main console window as well
 - now detect expressions with assignment or ++/-- operators as
    commands, do you can just say "pc=0" to modify registers instead
    of needing to type "do pc=0"
 - fixed bug that would sometimes lock the disassembly view to the
    top line

More global system cleanup: [Aaron Giles, Atari Ace]
 - remapped osd_die to fatalerror, which cleans up behind itself and
    returns to the osd code by returning from run_game
 - removed a number of unnecessary includes from driver.h
 - moved logerror into the core
 - moved 68000-specific build rules to cpu.mak
 - new function skip_this_frame, should be called by drivers instead
    of osd_skip_this_frame
 - removed includes of osdepend.h and osd_cpu.h from drivers; only the
    core should include these

More initialization/reset/pause cleanup: [Aaron Giles]
 - new function add_pause_callback can be called by other modules to
    register a callback for whenever MAME is paused/resumed
 - converted all existing pause hooks to use the new system
 - new function add_reset_callback can be called by other modules to
    register a callback for whenever MAME is reset
 - converted all existing reset hooks to use the new system
 - removed machine_reset; replaced with mame_schedule_soft_reset
 - new function mame_schedule_exit to force an exit cleanly from
    external events
 - removed all the "trying_to_quit" crap from the Windows code
 - moved save/restore system out of cpuexec.c into mame.c
 - moved core game loop out of cpuexec.c into mame.c
 - added hard reset support (complete tear down and re-init)

More core file shuffling: [Aaron Giles]
 - split sndintrf.c into sound.c, sndintrf.c, and sndhrdw/generic.c
 - added #include vidhrdw/generic.h to mamecore.h, and removed all 
    explicit includes elsewhere

Added save state support to the BSMT2000 sound emulator and the
dcheese driver. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed missing save state data in the dkong driver. [Aaron Giles]

Updated the 68000 disassembler to use the new interfaces.

IMPORTANT CHANGE FOR OSD DEVELOPERS: osd_exit is no longer called

Source Changes
--------------

Cleanups to the taito_x driver: [Alex Jackson]
 - Converted input ports to an INCLUDE/MODIFY tree.
 - Fixed Lives DSW in twinhawk and twinhwku
 - Removed Cabinet DSW from twinhawk and twinhwku; they are 2psim 
    and do not support cocktail cabinets (the DSW does nothing).
 - Fixed Coinage DSW in suprmanj
 - removed MDRV_MACHINE_INIT(cchip1) from games that don't have a 
    c-chip (all of them except superman)

Fixed chdman to write the correct number of logical bytes when
extracting something that is not an even number of hunks large.
[Chris Hardy]

Some Raiden 2 documentation and input port updates (still not 
playable). [Olivier Galibert]

Created new osd_tool file which is used by utility tools to do
file access in an OS independent manner. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed typo in Hyperstone core that led to false positive warning
popups. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added support for IDT-specific MIPS MUL instruction in the MIPS3
core, recompiler, and disassembler. [R. Belmont, Aaron Giles]

Replaced -high_priority with -priority, you can now specify from 
-15 to 1. The default is -15 as this makes Dell laptop keyboards 
work. It still won't raise the priority if running with the debugger,
but it will lower it. Fixed a subtle bug at the same time as 
-high_priority was only working when you used rdtsc. [smf]

Added an optional xml_parse_options parameter to xml_file_read() 
and xml_string_read(), to provide options for preserving whitespace,
error reporting, and parser setup. [Nathan Woods]

Added save states to 2 simple drivers - bombjack.c and blktiger.c. 
[Adam Bousley]

Improved graphics ROM loading order in fredmem. [Luigi30]

New option -mngwrite, which records an MNG movie of the game from
the get-go and allows you to specify a target filename. [Buddabing]

Refactored/renamed/removed/added several core files: [Aaron Giles]
 - renamed driver.c to mamedriv.c
 - created a new driver.c containing functions defined in driver.h
 - split common.c into video.c and machine/generic.c
 - moved a number of mame.c functions to video.c

New file debugger.h contains abstracted debugging interfaces for
both debuggers. Added new call mame_debug_break() and a new macro
DEBUGGER_BREAK to make it easier to hard-code breakpoints into code.
Removed all old code that directly whacked debug_key_pressed or
called debug_halt_on_next_instruction and replaced them with calls
to DEBUGGER_BREAK. [Aaron Giles]

Added #include "state.h" to driver.h. This means most driver files
no longer need to explicitly include it. Went through and removed it
from most drivers. [Aaron Giles]

Reorganized the core initialization/exit sequencing to be "flatter"
and more straightforward to understand. System cleanup is now no
longer explicitly called by the code in mame.c. Rather, each init
function is free to register an exit handler, which will be called
in reverse order of registration upon a system exit. [Aaron Giles]

Removed default registrations from config_init() into the init
functions of the associated modules. Now each system that has config
data can register its own callbacks to process it. [Aaron Giles]

Renamed MACHINE_INIT to MACHINE_RESET to normalize the naming of the
callbacks defined in the MACHINE_DRIVER structure. Added several new
callbacks. The complete list is now:

   DRIVER_INIT -- per-game init called once at startup
   MACHINE_START/SOUND_START/VIDEO_START -- called once at startup
   MACHINE_RESET/SOUND_RESET/VIDEO_RESET -- called each reset

Save state registrations should be performed in DRIVER_INIT or 
(preferably) in the _START callbacks; they should be avoided in the 
_RESET callbacks if possible. [Aaron Giles]

Removed VIDEO_DUAL_MONITOR flag. [Aaron Giles]

Added a number of new properties to the debug views to allow for more
flexibility in the way the views are displayed. Also added an option
to the disassembly window to display encrypted opcode data on the
right. [Aaron Giles]

Save state changes: [Aaron Giles]
 - Audited the use of save state registrations throughout the code,
    switching most cases over to using the state_save_register_global
    or state_save_register_item macros to simplify the code.
 - Deprecated the save_state_register_<type> calls since nearly all 
    cases can be automatically handled by the macros. For odd cases, 
    there is now a save_state_register_memory call which is generic.
 - Simplified the save state logic, allowing for unlimited instances
    and reducing the complexity of the code. This breaks existing save
    states. Sorry, I'll try not to do it again.

Fixed save state support in Missile Command. [Aaron Giles]

Added oversampling support to the CEM3394 emulator. [Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the CEM3394 and NES APU sound chips.
[Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the jedi, balsente and dkong drivers.

 - Fixed so top 8 bits of X & Y are preserved when in 8-bit index mode
 - Fixed some disassembly errors
 - Added save state support
 - Added M37702 alias for documentation purposes

Updates to the Namco System 22 driver: [R. Belmont]
 - Necessary changes to System 22 games to use the real C74 BIOS for 
    music/sound
 - Added system controller register to boot the C74
 - Speedup cheat for the CPU board C74
 - Promoted Ace Driver from NO_SOUND to IMPERFECT_SOUND

Made declarations and variables in a number of drivers static and 
const to reduce global namespace pollution. Fixed a number of 
multiply-defined global variables. [Atari Ace]

Added state save support to the Jaleco MegaSystem 32 and YMF271
sound core. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed Windows rendering code bug where -waitvsync had no effect when 
using -nohws -nod3d -notb. [Derrick Renaud]

Hooked up preliminary support for the text layer and palette in the
Namco System 23 driver. [R. Belmont]

Deprecated the use of multimon.h in the Windows build, which is only
necessary for producing Windows 95 and NT 4.0 compatible binaries.
Windows 98 is now the minimum version of Windows supported for MAME.
[Aaron Giles]

Made a few minor tweaks to the Windows sources to support the latest
build tools. See http://mamedev.org/tools if your tools are out of
date. [Aaron Giles]

Added assert_always macro which asserts even in a release build, and
requires a friendly message. [Aaron Giles]

Added new function xml_read_string, which allows for parsing of
internal strings into XML trees. [Aaron Giles]

Removed artificial gamma correction in nemesis driver. [Aaron Giles]

Removed scrbitmap and memory_region from the global Machine structure.
There is no need for non-core systems to access these directly.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed a ton of hacks that were checking for Machine->sample_rate==0,
which is now guaranteed to never be true. [Aaron Giles]

Split out ROM management from common.c and moved to a new file
romload.c. [Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the POKEY emulator. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up structs/unions in the debugger and Windows code to match 
the new core conventions. [Aaron Giles]

Added new function state_save_register_bitmap to simplify bitmap

Fixed minor color issue in Cookie & Bibi. [David Haywood]

Updates to the Hyperstone core: [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
 - Removed nested delays
 - Added better delay branch support
 - Fixed PC seen by a delay instruction, because a delay instruction
    should use the delayed PC (thus allowing the execution of 
    software opcodes too)

Hooked up watchdog for NeoGeo games and removed a number of hacks.
[David Haywood]

Fixed hanging at the end of level 3 in klondkp. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed inputs in Renju Kizoku, Neratte Chu, Mayjinsen 2 and some dips 
in Neratte Chu, Mayjinsen 2. [Sonikos]

Improved auto_malloc so it uses less memory and doesn't have a hard-
coded limit on the maximum number of allocations. Also audited the
use of auto_malloc in the code and removed unnecessary checks for
NULL (since auto_malloc doesn't return if it fails). [Atari Ace]

Fixed osd_fopen error reporting to return the correct value if you 
hit MAX_OPEN_FILES. [Nathan Woods]

Changed several byte operands in the i386 disassembler to be 
diassembled as unsigned rather than signed. [Nathan Woods]

Discrete sound updates: [Derrick Renaud]
 - Added new DISCRETE_CSVLOG module that lets you log discrete nodes 
    as CSV (comma separated values) data.
 - Modified discrete core to use the clock specified in the 
    MDRV_SOUND_ADD line.  If the clock is specified as 0, then the 
    discrete emulation will default to the audio sample rate clock.
 - Tweaked Phoenix Effect 2 sound to be more accurate matching 
    oscilliscope data.  Changed the Phoenix discrete clock rate to 
    a fixed rate of 120000 allowing the simulation to be more 
    accurate with less alaising noise at the cost of speed. 
 - Fixed the bug in the DISCRETE_NOTE module that produced notes 
    1 count off.

Added support for registers that are not to be displayed in the 
register list. This is useful for registers like AX on i386, so that
AX can be used in expressions but not represented on the register 
list. Simply precede the register name with '~' to prevent display.
[Nathan Woods, Aaron Giles]

Added support for the various x86 8-bit and 16-bit derived 
registers, as hidden registers in the i386 core. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed background music in ESB. Updated IRQ frequency and divider to 
match the schematics. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Improved dip switches for rocktrv2. [Chaneman]

Separated the allocation of graphics data from the decoding. This 
fixes the crashes that were introduced in u4, and will allow for 
decoding progress to be reported eventually. [Aaron Giles]

Made a clean-up pass over all the makefiles. rules.mak is gone now,
replaced by cpu.mak and sound.mak. mame.mak has been reorganized. All 
the makefiles are now commented and should be easier to follow. 
[Aaron Giles]

Rewrote artwork scaling function to compute accurate sum over all

Sync Refresh / Waitvsync / Triplebuffer changes [Alan Kamrowski II]
 * Changed the waitvsync code to wait for the beginning of the 
    vertical blank (the previous code simply checked if it was in the 
    vblank and only waited if it wasn't).
 * Removed the waitvsync only if game speed is above 95% restriction.
    This restriction would only cause waitvsync to vacillate between 
    on and off depending on game speed.
 * When syncrefresh and triplebuffer are used, MAME would run the 
    waitvsync code anyway. The triplebuffer code takes care of this 
    already.

Some minor cleanups to the System 32 driver. Air Rescue and F1 Exhaust Note
now share common multi-PCB faking logic. [Anonymous]

Properly hooked up tape samples in Thief, NATO Defense, and Shark Attack now
that sample pausing is available. [Bart Tobalske]

Fixed several uninitialized variables, incorrect string compares, and
inconsistent variable declarations found by the VC compiler. [Oshah]

Fixed 16-bit i386 disassembly so it stays within the current segment.
[Nathan Woods]

Some minor Turbo Sub changes: [Philip Bennett]
 * Added some more notes.
 * Corrected some hardware functions in accordance with the schematics.

Tweaked the 68000 disassembler to display F-line traps in a more obvious
fashion. Also changed to decorate jump targets for relative branches.
[Alex Jackson]

Rewrote the Voodoo emulation code to be more accurate to the original.
 * Support for multiple simultaneous boards (hello Silent Scope)
 * Pixel-pipelined framebuffer accesses now work
 * Alpha buffer operations now supported
 * Triple buffering now supported
 * Proper memory allocation and handling based on configuration
 * Proper FIFO handling, including low/high water marks and stalling
 * Approximate timing calculations based on quoted fill rate specs
 * Detail textures implemented
 * All math is done in fixed point
 * Proper edges calculated for polygons (stars appear in Gradius 4 now)
 * Much easier to add specific rasterizers now
This is a work in progress; some stuff is not quite right yet. Voodoo 2
emulation is completely broken. [Aaron Giles]

Added new inline math functions to mamecore.h, along with mechanisms for the
OSD layer to override them with platform-specific variants: 
count_leading_zeros, count_leading_ones, and fixed_mul_shift. Updated the
TMS32031 core to make use of the first two. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the Windows blitters to use an array allocated by 
osd_alloc_executable() to prevent potential access violations on systems
with no-execute support. [Aaron Giles]

instead of derived equations. [Hans Andersson, Derrick Renaud]

Added Tilemap0 color banking to esd16. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed save/restore of 8253 PIT. Also several updates to Top Gunner:
[Mathis Rosenhauer]
 * Removed shift register since it just seems to be needed to
    compensate for different DAC speeds
 * Added 8254 PIT from PC emulation
 * Added state saving

Fixed bug in PSX GTE flag settings. [Olivier Galibert]

Fixed 6502 initialization so that all internal states are reset properly.
[Nathan Woods]

Changed the makefile so that debug objects are not compiled on non-debug
builds. [Aaron Giles]

Marked most gfx_layout and gfx_decode structures in the code as const.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed handling of the FR bit in the Status register on MIPS3. This fixes a
few problems in CarnEvil, and probably affects a few other games as well.
Also fixed bug where TLB exceptions were not filling in the Context and
EntryHi registers correctly. [Aaron Giles]

Removed ROMREGION_SOUNDONLY. Since -nosound no longer disables sound CPUs or
sound cores (and hasn't for a while), failing to load sound ROMs was only
leading to crashes. [Aaron Giles]

Implemented pixel-accurate dithering in the Voodoo emulation. [Aaron Giles]

Renamed my_stricmp to mame_stricmp, converted all uses of stricmp in the
code to call mame_stricmp, and #defined stricmp to something invalid to

Fixed sprites wrap around in st0016 (needed in nratechu). 
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Model 3 update: [Ville Linde]
 * Added Daytona USA 2 Power Edition
 * Huge update to the video hardware, including:
    - Transparency support (polygons and textures)
    - Nearly perfect rendering order (something we never got right in 
      Supermodel :-)
    - Parallel lighting
    - Texture coordinate mirroring

Added very experimental rasterizer generator for the Voodoo emulator, which
generates X86 assembly blitters optimized for each case. Unfortunately, it
doesn't help performance much and they are still too buggy so they are
disabled for now. Enable them in the makefile. [Aaron Giles]

Made some of the hack optimizations runtime enableable in the Voodoo
emulator, and added a frameskipper. Use Ctrl+1-6 to control frameskipping,
Ctrl+F/H/Q to run at full/half/quarter resolution. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote most of the validity checks so the full set now completes in well
under 1 second, minus I/O time from paging in data. Also added region
size checking versus memory maps to the validity checks. Moved all validity
checks to a new file validity.c. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the AM_REGION() macro to store region/offset information instead of
a pointer to simplify some of the region valdation code. [Aaron Giles]

Source Changes
--------------

Fixed a number of games that were broken with the u1 update. Just a few
more cases remain. Most games are working at this point. [Aaron Giles, with
contributions from El Condor, R. Belmont, Ville Linde]

Added preliminary save state support to Missile Command and Battlezone.
[Buddabing]

Fixed some dips in Pop's Pop's. [Sonikos]

Fixed inputs in Woodpecker. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Updated PowerPC core to use new disassembler style. [Nathan Woods]

Merged in recent updates from MESS PC emulation code. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed DTD in the -listxml output. [Oliver Stoneberg] 

Added sprites banking, tile banking, sound banking, and a couple of
DIP switches to Egg Hunt. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Updated 6502 family of disassemblers to the new disassembler style. Added
internal memory maps for the m6510 and m4510 CPU cores. Updated m4510 to
use address translation hooks. [Nathan Woods]

Reduced how often the debugger display is refreshed if stepping and
steps_until_stop is a high number.  This makes commands like 'step 
#10000' a bit more usable. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed MESS UI code that prevented P and Esc from being intercepted properly.
[Lawrence Gold]

Added check and failure for 0-sized mallocs. [Nathan Woods]

Updated i86 and i286 cores to hook into the new i386 disassembler.
[Nathan Woods]

Added MMU support to the MIPS3 dynamic recompiler. Re-enabled it by default.
Added direct fast RAM access to the dynamic recompiler, as well as optional
hotspot optimizations. Most games should show a net speedup over the pre-MMU
compiler. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed FPU decoding and a few other minor issues in the i386 disassembler.
[Aaron Giles]

Added rudimentary hotspot detection to the debugger. Type "help hotspot" for
details on how it works. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up the way the debugger hooks into the memory subsystem. Now, on each
CPU switch, the debugger queries the memory system for callbacks to be called
on every read/write. This allows more efficient watchpoint tracking and allows
for non-watchpoint debugging behaviors like the hotspot detection.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed the way encrypted CPU memory is allocated and managed. Previously,
memory_set_opcode_base() was used to set a single pointer to the decrypted
opcodes; however this presented a number of limitations. Now that all RAM and
ROM-like regions are assigned banks, the memory system now tracks decrypted
opcodes per bank. For implicit banks (marked RAM or ROM in the memory map),
a new function memory_set_decrypted_region() configures which areas of the
address space contain decrypted opcodes and where the decrypted opcodes live.
For explicit banks, there is a new function memory_configure_bank_decrypted()
which operates identically to memory_configure_bank() but specifies a pointer
to the decrypted opcodes on a per-bank basis. Updated all drivers using the
old mechanism to the new mechanism and removed the old system. [Aaron Giles]

Thanks to the new opcode handling, removed "RAMROM" support from the memory
subsystem altogether, and updated all drivers to simply limit their decryption
to areas that the CPU decrypted. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed activecpu_dasm() and cpunum_dasm() to detect the presence of an updated
disassembler and wraps the calls to that rather than crashing. [Aaron Giles]

--------------

Fixed time stamp counter in the Pentium core. [Ville Linde]

Fixed Z80 behavior on cold versus warm reset. [Frank Palazzolo]

Fixed a number of games that were broken due to the recent memory system
changes. There are still more problems to fix; continue reporting them.
[Aaron Giles]

Added support for logical mapping to the CPU interfaces and debugger. CPUs
that have an MMU now need to support several new interface bits, including
a logical address mask and page size for each address space, as well as a
new translate function. There is also a new disassembler interface that
should be used going forward, which will make it much simpler to keep the
disassemblers standalone and not dependent on MAME functions for opcode
accesses. Converted the i386 core to use the new interfaces. [Aaron Giles]

Added MMU support to the non-drc MIPS3 emulator. Converted the Killer
Instinct, Seattle, Vegas, and Hyper Neo-Geo 64 drivers to a proper physical 
memory layout. Disabled the drc MIPS3 core until MMU support is added there 
as well. [Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the S2650 CPU. [Aaron Giles]

Got rid of gross banking hack in the T11 core. Updated Atari System 2 drivers
to accommodate the lack of the hack. [Aaron Giles]

Imported a number of memory handler conversion helpers from MESS, placed 
them in memconv.h. [Aaron Giles]

Some improvements to M37710, C352 and NamcoNA sound. [cync]

Corrected CPS1 frequencies based on measurements from a real PCB.
[Philip Bennett]

Significant change to the memory system. RAM areas are now no longer 
allocated out of the memory_region for a given CPU. This means that drivers
which assume that RAM is located at some offset to the base of the memory
region will be broken. [Aaron Giles]

Added save state information for streams so that dynamic volume changes
get properly restored. Unfortunately this breaks all existing save states.
[Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the HC55516 sound chip. Added save state support
to the Williams sound boards. Added save state support to games in the
mcr3.c and mcr68.c drivers, marking them as GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE. [Aaron Giles]

Changed timer_alloc_ptr-style timers so that the pointer parameter is
supplied at allocation time and is not changeable. This makes these timers
more easily supported in save states. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed missing save state registrations in the m6809 CPU core. [Aaron Giles]

Deferred state loading until all anonymous timers have cleared. This fixes
issues where the timers would fire after the load and would clobber data 
that was just loaded. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up and fully mapped the Williams sound boards. Also added save state
support to them. [Aaron Giles]

Wired up save state support for all the games in pacman.c, jrpacman.c, and
pengo.c. Marked all games as GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE. [Aaron Giles]

Added new generic macros to state.h to make it simpler to do save states.
Use state_save_register_global(var) to register a driver-related global
variable. Use state_save_register_item(module, instance, var) to register
other variables with specific module and instance names. Converted the MCR
and Cinematronics vector saves over to this. As a result, save states for
games will be incompatible with prior versions of MAME. [Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the 8255 PPI, 7474 TTL, and the TMS5110 sound 
chip. Added save state support to the galaxian.c driver and all the 
associated drivers. Marked all games in galaxian.c, scramble.c, scobra.c,
frogger.c, and amidar.c as GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the timing of save state bank registration so that dynamically
installed banks will work properly. [Aaron Giles]

Updated 65816 and 37710 cores: [R. Belmont]
 * Fixed both CPUs to set the data bank register to the destination on 
    an MVN/MVP
 * Some minor tweeks so the debugger works properly when the 65816 is 
    executing out of a read handler (as it always is for the SNES)

Filled in missing asteroids DIP switches. [Kevin Jonas]

Updates to the I386 core: [Ville Linde]
 * Added i486, Pentium and Cyrix MediaGX CPUs
 * Replaced the opcode tables with a dynamically built one

 * Tons of bugfixes
Also updated the SPI driver to work with these changes.

Cleaned up the taito_f2 driver: [Brian Troha]
 * Converted what I could to port_include and port_modify
 * Fixed a few rom names and standardized names add a PCB layout.
 * Changed the sound CPU to 240000/6 and the YM2610 to 240000/3 as there 
    is no 16MHz OSC on the PCB.  Only a 26.686 & 24.000 MHz chips.

Fixed inputs in vliner: [Mamesick]

Added some basic zooming support to the gstriker/twcup94 driver.
[David Haywood]

Improved accuracy of joystick types reported in -listxml. [Buddabing]

Added "Uptime" to the bookkeeping info displayed in the UI. [Aaron Giles]

Added new driver flag: GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE, to indicate drivers which have
save state support that is supposed to work. Attempting to save state on
a game without this flag will give a warning. Save state-related bugs may be 
filed against drivers with this flag set. [Aaron Giles]

Removed the GAMEX and GAMEBX macros. The flags parameter has been moved into
the GAME and GAMEB macros and these are used for all games. [Aaron Giles]

Converted a few more drivers over to using the new memory_configure_bank
calls. [Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the Cinematronics vector sound hardware and to
the Z80 CTC system. Also fixed QB3 banking when used with save states.
Marked all the games in cinemat.c with GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE.

More Sega C2/Genesis-based games cleanup: [Aaron Giles]
 * fixed crashes introduced in last version
 * centralized interrupt generation for all Genesis-based games
 * implemented protection correctly for Puyo Puyo 2

Changed validity checks to use hashes for speed. Also changed them to only
run on the drivers in the source file of the current game, rather than on all
games, in non-debug builds. And fixed the coinage sorting check so that it
doesn't depend on the linker to order the strings in a particular way.
[Paul Priest]

Removed -skip_validitychecks option now that the time to execute the checks
is not as bad. [Aaron Giles]

Improved speed in Top Gunner by pre-decoding the vector processor microcode.
Also added a shift register to produce the LCD-like look of the score and
other numbers. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Nintendo Super System sound update: [R. Belmont]
 * Fixed bugs in SPC700 ADC, SBC, ADDW, SUBW, MUL, DIV, & CLRV opcodes
 * Fixed several APU hardware/timer issues
 * Added accurate sound DSP emulation from the latest OpenSPC
 * Fixed some timing issues that prevented ActRaiser from syncing up
Result: generally accurate sound in the working NSS games, and in many 
SNES games over in MESS as well.

 * Beat Head (video update)
 * Hit Me (graphics decode)
 * Imago (palette setup)
 * Legend of Kage bootlegs (accessing invalid CPU)
 * Rock Climber
 * Speed Attack (palette out of range)

TumblePop driver updates: [David Haywood]
 * split driver into tumblep.c and tumbleb.c
 * tumblep.c runs the original tumble pop sets and use now using 
    deco16ic.c for the gfx.
 * tumbleb.c runs the bootlegs and games which use hardware which works 
    in a similar way to tumble pop (semicom titles etc.)

Kludged around glitches in Monster World. [David Haywood]

Cross Pang is now using the sprite draw copied from tumbleb.c instead as 
the game also seems to be based around Tumble Pop designs, as a result the 
'Alpha Blend' bit has been removed and replaced with a flicker sprite bit 
like Tumble Pop which looks more correct to me.  Also changed some default 
settings. [David Haywood]

Corrected Indian Battle DIP switches. [ShimaPong]

Updated D-Day DIP switches to use conditionals. [James Wallace]

More Namco sound/MCU updates: [R. Belmont]
 * Fixed analog controls for Ridge Racer and Rage Racer
 * Fixed sound/music to play in System 22 games
 * Fully share the sound part of the MCU RAM for System 11. This allows 
    games to read back the song names and fixes the sound test menu in 
    Tekken and Tekken 2.

Cleaned up MESS hooks into the input port system. [Nathan Woods]

Major Namco sound improvements: [R. Belmont]
 * C352 now sets output pitch correctly by input clock
 * Added emulated sound and music to all NB-1, NB-2,
    and System 11 games, using Prop Cycle's BIOS as a
    substitute until the original can be trojaned or
    otherwise obtained
 * Hooked it up for plain System 22 games as well, but
    they're not interested in passing down proper commands
    for some reason
 * Speed-cheated all instances of the M37710/C352 sound
    system so CPU requirements don't go up much.  This
    also helped back off the requirements a hair for Prop
    Cycle and Time Crisis

 * stv:  changed v-blank timing
 * vdp1: implemented two framebuffers and flipping
 * vdp1: added manual changing and erasing of framebuffers
 * vdp1: added manual trigger for drawing

    bakubaku intro)
 * vdp2: added preliminary window effect for tilemaps and sprite layer
    (for batmanfr)
 * vdp2: added scaling for 8bpp and 15bpp bitmaps (fixes vmahjong and
    myfairld backgrounds)

Fixed sprite-sprite priorities in toaplan1 games. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed background color in Jolly Jogger. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Made input port conditionals work more generically. This necessitated a bit
of a minor reorg in the input port code. Please verify that controls work as
before. This change has also required a modification to how analog ports are
recorded, so existing INPs may not work. [Aaron Giles]

Minor tweak to fix Time Crisis crash. [Phil Stroffolino]

Fixed spurious vectors in Top Gunner. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Added new functions memory_configure_bank() and memory_set_bank() which
abstract bankswitching better. This allows current memory banking states to
automatically be saved for drivers that use this feature. m62.c games have
been updated to use this new feature as an example. [Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the Cinematronics vector games. [Buddabing]

Added blending to the alt tilemap code in psikyosh.c, fixing the final
boss in Sol Divide. [David Haywood]

Improvements to the Witch/Pinball Champ '95 driver: [Sebasten Hegon]
 * The games now show some graphics (the palette seems OK) and play some 
    music and sounds.
 * Since the controls are not yet figured out completely, they are still 
    mapped as dipswitches.
 * An NVRAM reset is required the first time you launch Witch (via the 
    associated dipswitch). Pinball Champ seems to automatically do this.
 * The sound part required some patching in sound/es8712.c. I disabled 
    the hardcoded inconditional looping, and made the sound start when 
    writing at offset 0x06 (cf patch). vmetal does not seem to be affected.
 * As far as gameplay is concerned, the ball will freeze (in game and 
    demo mode), and I don't know why. The video hardware is not completely 
    figured out and may be the culprit.
 * The coin in/out mecanism needs some work too.

Some improvements to Jolly Card: [Roberto Fresca]
 * Added extra hardware info (pinouts and dips).
 * Added the correct dipswitch to Jolly Card. Hopper and Points/pulse not 
    tested due to preliminary driver state. The rest are working properly.
    Remember to delete the nvram and reinitialize to see some changes.
 * Added almost the same dipswitch to Magic Card II (Bulgaria).

Significant changes to the save state system: [Aaron Giles]
 * Added alternate save state pre-/post-load function types that take
    integer or pointer parameters. Updated several sound cores and other 
    files to take advantage of this.
 * Made state handler registrations track like other scoped resources
    (timers, memory) so that registrations can occur as late as 
    MACHINE_INIT time.
 * Added logic to detect registrations after MACHINE_INIT time and prevent
    saves in that case.
 * Added logic to detect when CPUs or sound chips haven't registered 
    anything to save/load. When this happens, info is logged to error.log
    and saves/loads are disallowed.
 * Allocated timers are now automatically saved and restored as part of
    the save state. The global time is now restored as well as a bunch of
    CPU execution state. This should produce more reliable restores.
 * Added logic to defer saves until all anonymous timers have cleared. If 
    a driver uses many anonymous timers it may not be possible to ever 
    successfully save, so the operation will time out after one second.
 * Before restoring, the machine is now reset. This gives a more
    consistent environment for the load to occur.
 * Re-enabled save state support for YM2151.
 * Added save state support to the classic Namco sound system.
 * Added save state support to the samples sound system.
 * Removed anonymous timer usage in machine/scramble.c.

         vfremix, thunt, sassisu backgrounds)
 - vdp2: added 15bit RGB tilemaps (used by thunt)
 - vdp2: added opaque alpha blended bitmaps (fixes missing gfx in

 - vdp2: added alpha blending for RGB sprites
 - vdp1: fixed polygon drawing

 - stv:  added idle loop skipping for several games
 - dsp:  fixed dma (fixes some bad gfx in thunt)

Added dsp56k CPU core and hooked it up to the Polygonet Commanders
driver. [Andrew Gardner]

SCSI hard disk updates: [R. Belmont]
 - Added FORMAT UNIT, READ (6 byte), WRITE (6 byte), READ (12 byte), 
    MODE SENSE, and READ CAPACITY commands.
 - Changed INQUIRY to ID as a real Seagate model, which makes MacOS 
    much happier than a manufacturer code of "MAME".
 - Some MESS-specific tweeks to initialization.

Fixed all the volume table calculations in the YMF271 core. [Ville Linde]

SPI Improvements: [Ville Linde, Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

 - Hooked up eeprom in rdft2us, rfjetus and rdft22kc

Fixed recent LSI53C810 update which caused the Model 3 games to crash.
[Ville Linde]

Fixed PowerPC recompiler so that Scud Race works again. [Ville Linde]

Significant overhaul of the user interface infrastructure: [Aaron Giles]
 - All user interface rendering is now cached until the end and rendered 
    in one pass.
 - A large number of extraneous and redundant functions have been removed 
    and replaced with a smaller set of more flexible APIs.
 - Global access to the UI fonts and colortables is now gone, they are 
    private to the user interface code.
 - All global user interface function names have been normalized. Most
    importantly, usrintf_showmessage is now ui_popup.
 - Pause behavior has been redefined; instead of sitting in a tight loop,
    the code proceeds normally, but the CPU execution system does not
    advance time.
 - Code for the menus has been reworked; some menus are temporarily not
    available (cheats, memory cards).

Removed the internal display of history.dat. Cramming this kind of data
into MAME's limited UI is not really useful, and viewing the history.dat
information is supported by many frontends and websites. [Aaron Giles]

Removed the following obsolete and/or redundant command line options from

 -wrongfps
 -gamelist

Prior versions of MAME have excluded some drivers (primarily gambling-
related) for philosophical reasons. Since these games are legitimately at
risk of being lost to the ages, and many of them have strong similarities
to the other sorts of games MAME emulates, it has been decided to allow their
inclusion going forward. The criteria for inclusion in MAME is now simply
"any primarily video based arcade machine, driven by one of more CPUs," and
should relieve any confusion surrounding this issue going forward.

    which can be used to read the contents of attached ROM or RAM.
 - Hooked up the mask ROM tests in the service menu - both the tile 
    character ROMS and the sound ROMs now can be tested.

be invalid after this update. Your default.cfg and existing controller-
specific .cfg files should work fine. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed all the mystwarr.c games so they pass their service mode mask ROM 
tests, with the exception of Metamorphic Force (it gets hung up on the road
generator ("LVC") test for some reason). [R. Belmont]

Fixed Monster Bash (2-board version) so it works now, though the graphics
are still not perfect. [David Haywood, MASH]

Turned off -fomit-frame-pointer in optimized builds. It was leading to 
crashes when used with setjmp/longjmp on Windows builds. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed tilemap priorities and sprites in Flying Tiger. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added green overlay to Meadows Lanes. [MASH]

Various improvements to the simple Deco 156 games: [David Haywood]

Source Changes
--------------

Added new 'screen' parameter to the VIDEO_UPDATE callbacks. It is not
currently used but is a placeholder for the future. [Aaron Giles]

Replaced direct access to Machine->scrbitmap in the following drivers with
the use of force_partial_update(): m92.c, m107.c, astrocde.c, battlera.c,
snes.c. [Aaron Giles]

Rewrote the Z80/Z180 daisy chaining logic to work a little closer to the
hardware. Updated the Z80 CTC and PIO modules to support the new model.
Changed the CTC module to not generate interrupts if there is an outstanding
request on the same timer is currently in service; this allows Journey to 
(finally) run with the correct CPU speed. [Aaron Giles]

Partial rewrite of the MCR video system. Should still work roughly the same,
just a little different under the covers. This is still very much a work in
progress. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed clipping in nemesis.c. [Fujix]

Normalized names in Konami drivers according R. Belmont's wishes. [Mamesick]

More PowerPC updates: [Nathan Woods]
 - Moved update_counters() to be executed after the DRC epilogue code 
    is appended; now behaves more like the non-DRC core
 - Fixed some bugs in DRC exeception handling (SRR1 was not being set 
    up properly, and not all MSR flags were being cleared)
 - Refactored DRC core to call MMU hooks
 - ISI exceptions will now be thrown if the MMU hooks report an 
    unexecutable address in the DRC core
 - Fixed a rounding error in the decrementer
 - Added support for decrementer exceptions when the DEC register is 
    written to in both cores
 - Added support for ISI/DSI exceptions with setjmp()/longjmp() in 
    the non-DRC core

Significant rewrite of the Legend of Kage driver: [Phil Stroffolino]
 - correct/added dipswitches
 - converted to use pdrawgfx; affects stage#4
 - a priority effect on the title screen has been mapped - this gives the 
    foreground layer priority over all sprites, and screenshots now match 
    those from arcade flyers.
 - the "virtual palette" hack has been removed; it was an optimization from 
    back when we used 8 bit color and hardware palettes.

Cleaned up the Soungoku Mahjong driver, fixed colors, improved sound and 
fixed the hang before the match started. Also I found the output for the 
coins used to play the match. It's still missing something to enable / 
disable the tilemaps. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed the i386->z80 communication in the Seibu SPI driver. This fixes the 
flash rom update and should also fix any remaining hangs/pauses. The flash 
rom update should take around 5 minutes. Now all games should have proper 
sample data. [Ville Linda, David Haywood]

Source Changes

Changed how perodic timers are defined. Previously, you would specify a
number which was interpreted either as Hz (if less than 50000) or as
nanoseconds (if greater than 50000). Now, the time is specified as a period
and you use the standard TIME_IN_HZ or TIME_IN_NS macros. [Aaron Giles]

Turned on address error checking in the 68000 core. This slows things down a
bit but is more accurate and allows correct behavior of a couple of badly-
programmed games. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed several issues with address error checking in the 68000 core.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed 68000 bug that treated 8-bit branches with $FF offsets as illegal,
rather than allowing them and generating an address error. [Aaron Giles]

Created a new header file mamecore.h, which contains the core common useful
macros and typedefs that were scattered throughout the header files. Also
added endian swapping macros from MESS. [Aaron Giles]

Fully deprecated the use of cpu_setbank(), which was long ago replaced with
memory_set_bankptr(). [Aaron Giles]

Did some major cleanup on the MCR drivers [Aaron Giles]
- Implemented Super Sound I/O interrupts properly.
- Filled out all memory maps according to schematics.
- Fixed sound sync with various sound boards, allowing for kludges to be
  removed from Power Drive and Star Guards.
- Re-verified all connections from wiring diagrams.
- Documented various lamp and driver boards from the games.

Some makefile tweaks to hopefully catch variable declaration problems that
kept creeping into builds. Switched gcc compiler standard to gnu89.
[Atari Ace]

Removed usage of dirent.h APIs on Windows builds. [Atari Ace]

Corrected resolution to 256x256 in Stagger I, Red Hawk, Sen Jin - Guardian 
Storm. All other games still have old visible area that is correct for them.
[Mamesick]

Fixed crash in Volfied and Operation Wolf due to improper timer usage.
[Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed one of the TC360 sprite blending modes (used in Pulirula round 2 and 
Liquids Kids attract mode). [Bryan McPhail]

Fixed sprite/tilemap placement in Legend of Kage. [Phil Stroffolino]

PowerPC core update: [Nathan Woods]
- Added infrastructure to generate DSI and ISI exceptions
- Made the lbz/lbzu/lbzux/lbzx instructions properly clear out the 
  high 24 bits in the results

Did some cleanups in the vamphalf.c driver. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed speedbal again, after breaking it in the last update. 
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

[Brian Troha]

Replaced old Outrun bootleg with a new dump that passes the ROM test and has

  in EDX, and EDX is not preserved across the call to ppc_set_msr()
- Implemented recompile_fcmpo()
- Fixed certain rules in rules.mak (some said drc_ops.h instead of 
  drc_ops.c)
- Commented the MSR_* values
- Moved BAT registers into their own structure
- Added DSI and ISI exceptions (non-DRC core only for now)
- Moved READ*/WRITE* functions into ppc_mem.c
- Changed memory handling so that reading and writing are done 
  through function pointers that can be changed at runtime (which would 
  be useful if, say a MMU was implemented in the future :-))

PSX/Namco System 12 improvements: [smf]
- Added Tenkomori Shooting
- Updated board notes from Guru.
- Removed rom patches from the namco system 12 driver
- Renamed sound program roms.

- Added the second SHARC
- Fixed all the problems caused by the previous update

Fixed incorrect test in sauro.c video system. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Improved Lethal Enforces sprites, allowing 2 sprite chips to be created.
[David Haywood]

Rewrote the System 32 mixer to support accurate implementation of the alpha
blending modes. Sprite shadows and several other effects are still not yet

Renamed Hollywood Action to Action Hollywood. [David Haywood]

Major video update to Taito F3 driver that amongst other things properly 
implements zoom & column scroll according to how the hardware does it,

removed also.  Sprite & tilemap clipping is also implemented, as is
proper priority mixing and alpha-blending on the vram and pixel
layers. [Bryan McPhail]

Fixed exception handling and task switching in the V60 core. [Aaron Giles]

Add preliminary sound support for Action Hollywood. [Quench]

Improvements to the PSX CPU core [smf]

* Major update to Namco System 21 driver [Phil Stroffolino]

  - Starblade is working with emulated master/slave DSPs.  Graphic updates
  are a bit choppy; I believe there are 4 slaves and one master on the
  real PCB, with work distributed across the slaves.  Some background
  objects are still missing in Starblade - the giant "starships" in the
  background of the first stage, for example (sprites are present showing
  burning fires which are supposed to be superimposed on them).  The
  "direct drawing" feature is used during the high score presentation;
  colors are likely wrong, and there are missing graphics there as well
  (hexagons).

  - Solvalou works, but occasionally 3d graphics stop updating; press "A"
  to unblock the pipeline and resume drawing them.

  - The other System 21 titles are not working for various reasons. 
  Solvalou needed cuskey support (used from the master DSP).  Cybersled
  appears to use a different mechanism for uploading DSP code.

* Fixed road colors in the Suzuka games. [Phil Stroffolino]

* Added home/end key support in the history display. [Samuele Zannoli]

* Added debugger suppot for the decrementer register in the PowerPC
core. [Nathan Woods]

* Implemented column scroll in TC0100SCN chip; used on (at least)
Ninja Kids, Gun Frontier, Growl and Galemedes. [Bryan McPhail]

* Added ADSP-21062 core and partially hooked it up for the Model 2B
games. [Ville Linde]

* Additional progress on the PowerPC DRC (faster), support for
more exceptions, better support for the PPC internal serial ports.
[Ville Linde]

* Progress on the Konami PowerPC drivers [Ville Linde]
  - Cleaned up and consolidated common hardware
  - Hooked up ADSP-21062 and 3dfx chips
  - Initial reverse-engineering work on the KS001005
  custom 3D chipset in GTI Club
  - Initial NVRAM values plugged in for many games. 
  (They're used as a crude protection, similar to the
  EEPROM on GV System).
  - No games are playable or even show much yet, but
  nearly all of them do pass POST now.

* Fixed a minor bug in the SCSP timer handling. [Ville Linde]

* Fixed memory leak in the cpu subsystem. [Aaron Giles]

Source Changes
--------------

Added the ability to specify internal read/write handlers for CPUs so
that the new debugger can view internal RAM. Hooked this up for the
TMS32025 core. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed window mode 1 in the TMS34010 core, as well as bugs that prevented
misaligned stack accesses from working and a bug that didn't force the
PC to be 16-bit aligned. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug in MAC instructions in the TMS32025 core. Also fixed cycle
counting 
problems that led to inaccurate internal timers. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed end-of-sprite list and flip screen in Hollywood Action.
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed colors in New Sinbad 7. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Several Taito SJ sprite fixes:
- Fixed sprite priorites. This fixes several priority issues in Tin Star,
  Elevator Action, High Way Race, and the car wrapping around in Elevator
  Action at the end of a level.
- Added sprite clipping at the sides of the screen. This was verified to
  happen on the real board, and it affects bullets wrapping around in 
  Elevator Action. I'm only 99% sure that the clipping is correct this 
  way :)
- Fixed sprite hardware collision detection. This fixes the last round in
  Pirate Pete, bonuses in Alpine Ski, end of level 1 in Water Ski.
[Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed DIP switches in Rohga. [Yasuhiro Ogawa]

Several Volfied fixes:

Hooked up MSM5205 to Goal! '92 and to Euro League (bootleg), but it
doesn't sound too good yet. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Cleaned up the decryption in the Epos games. [Nicola Salmoria]

Changed xday2 to use default namcona1 joystick inputs. With those, if 
you wait the initial test to finish, you can play it. [Sonikos]

Fixed L button in mj4simai which was missing. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added support for Single monitor Playchoice 10 BIOS. Since the core 
doesn't allow you to change aspect ratio or remove dual monitor flag at 
run-time, the game always runs in the upper part of the screen. 
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added a -debugscript command line parameter that invokes a debugger 
script on startup [Nathan Woods]

Modified the MIPS DRC core to disable optimizations when mame_debug is
on. This makes it easier to run comparative traces when running both 
with and without MIPS DRC enabled. [Nathan Woods]

Simplified the decryption code in the sun8 driver, and made some
improvements to the Brick Zone main set. [Nicola Salmoria]

Patched the non-DRC PPC core to compile properly when not all PPC 
cores (403, 602, 603) are enabled. Implemented fcmpo instruction.
[Nathan Woods]

0.93

The main feature of this release is Aaron's huge update to the sound system.
There is a high chance this has introduced new sound / crashing bugs in
several drivers. A number of problems were already found and fixed prior to
the 0.93 release thanks to Aaron, Derrick and R.Belmont.  Updates will follow
to correct any severe bugs found.  Please test this release extensively.

----

Sound System update [Aaron Giles]
 (see list below for changes)

Sound System Changes
--------------------

Core changes
-----------

common.c:
* Changed auto_malloc() behavior so that a failure is absolute (calls 
osd_die); you can now assume that auto_malloc will always succeed and will 
never return NULL.
* Removed all sample loading code; this is now in sound/samples.c

config.c:
* Tried to update this to the new mixer stuff in usrintrf.c, but it hasn't 
been tested and I bet it's busted somehow.

driver.h:
* driver->sound_attributes is gone; if you need to detect stereo support, 
count the speakers.

mame.h:
* Machine->samples is history (yay!)

timer.c:
* I created a new type of timer that has a pointer for a callback param 
instead of an int. These sit next to the existing timer code, so nothing 
else is affected. They made object orienting the sound cores much much 
cleaner.

usrintrf.c:
* Mixing volumes are retrived from the sound core, not from the mixer (which 
is gone). Mixing volumes can now be overdriven to 2.0 (could be increased in 
the future)


Machine driver changes
----------------------

* MDRV_SPEAKER_ADD is how to create a new speaker. You specify a name and a 
3D vector for where the speaker is relative to the player's head.
* MDRV_SPEAKER_REMOVE and MDRV_SPEAKER_REPLACE operate as expected.
* MDRV_SPEAKER_STANDARD_MONO("name") specifies a single standard mono 
speaker positioned directly in front of the user.
* MDRV_SPEAKER_STANDARD_STEREO("leftname","rightname") specifies a standard 
pair of stereo speakers situated to the left/right of the user.

* MDRV_SOUND_ADD now takes a 'clock' parameter instead of an interface 
pointer. The clock for each chip is specified here rather than in the 
interface. I have removed any 'clock'-like parameters from all the sound 
interface structures.
* MDRV_SOUND_CONFIG is where you specify the interface. This mirrors 
MDRV_CPU_CONFIG. Note that you do not have to specify a config; in this 
case, it is NULL. This is ok. Many sound chips really only need a clock and 
volume info (which has also been removed from the interface structs).
* MDRV_SOUND_ROUTE is how to control where a sound chip outputs its data. 
The first parameter is the output index, or ALL_OUTPUTS if you want to route 
all the outputs for a given chip to the same place. The second parameter is 
either the name of a speaker or the name of another tagged sound chip. The 
third parameter is a floating point gain: 1.0 is standard.
* You can specify as many sound routes as you need; multiple routes for the 
same output will split the sound. For example, you can route the single mono 
output of an OKIM6295 to both the left and right speakers on a stereo 
system.


Sound core interface changes
----------------------------

mixer.c/.h:
* These files are gone, gone, gone. Everything is handled by the streams or 
by sndintrf.c directly. Mixing is performed by code in sndintrf.c which 
creates a stream to do the final mixing.

sndintrf.h:
* We now no longer #include every sound core's header. You have to include 
them yourself in your driver.

sndintrf.c:
* Sound cores are now hooked up very much like CPU cores. There is a single 
get_info function that is public for each core; all other functions and data 
are retrieved through it.
* Similar to CPU cores, you can call sndtype_xxx() to query/set values for a 
specific sound chip type; you can also call sndnum_xxx() to query/set values 
for an indexed sound chip in the Machine->drv->sound array; finally, you can 
call sndti_xxx() to query/set values for the nth instance of any give sound 
chip type (sndti = sound type+index).
* At startup, all sound cores/filters are created. Then all the speakers are 
created. Finally, everything is wired up together. There are new consistency 
checks to make sure you don't do anything wildly bad.
* sndintrf.c calls the OSD layer now, and always requests stereo output. It 
also does a final downmix from the various speaker streams into left/right 
streams based on the X coordinate of the speaker.

sound/streams.c:
* I have added a new type defined in sound/streams.h: stream_sample_t, which 
is used to represent a sample as used by the stream system. It is typedef'd 
to an INT32.
* Regardless of the size of stream_sample_t, all streams should be generated 
as if 16 bits were the maximum. The extra bits give us headroom to overdrive 
things if we want.
* All streams have the same format callback, with support for multiple 
inputs and outputs.
* Each stream has a sample rate; inputs to that stream will be 
down/upsampled to that rate; outputs will be down/upsampled as necessary to 
connect to the input of the next stream/speaker in line.
* Each input to a stream has its own gain, and each output has a gain as 
well. These can be controlled while things are running to provide some extra 
volume knobs.
* I haven't done much in the way of optimizations in order to keep things 
simple and working. Once things are back to normal, I may consider some 
additional optimizations.


Notes for sound core authors
----------------------------

* I marked all sound cores as Copyright the MAME Team; if you want your own 
credit there, feel free to send an update.
* I removed all volume and clock speeds from the interfaces; these are 
specified elsewhere now.
* I made interfaces optional for many sound chips that often don't need an 
interface.
* Many sound cores used global variables and assumed a single instance of 
themselves; this has been fixed in all cases.
* In some cases I removed global lookup tables and pushed them into the 
sound interfaces. This can eventually be fixed but I didn't want to deal 
with it.
* stream_init and stream_init_multi are gone; there is only stream_create 
now.
* Streams are named for you automatically, so you don't need to pass in 
names to stream_create. Volumes are also outside of your control now, so you 
don't need to pass in volumes to stream_create either.
* The get_info function can return pointers to set_info(), start(), stop(), 
and reset(). There is no concept of an update() function anymore -- updates 
are handled via streams.
* The start() function is passed three things: a 'sound index', which 
indicates which instance of chip you are (i.e., 0 if you're the first chip 
of this type to be created, 1 if you're the second, etc); a 'clock' which is 
specified in the driver (no clocks in the interfaces please!); and a 
'config' which is a pointer to the interface for this chip (it can be NULL 
too, be careful).
* The start() function now is expected to allocate memory for its data 
structures and return a pointer to that if successful. If not, it should 
return NULL.
* The pointer returned by the start() function is passed to the stop() and 
reset() functions.
* Since there were many cases where we provided a read/write handler for the 
'nth' chip, you can also fetch the pointer from the start() function by 
calling sndti_token(chip_type, index).
* If you have a non-digital chip that doesn't do internal clipping, you can 
probably remove the clipping code and let the mixer clip it in the end.
* If you do your mixing in a secondary buffer to get more bits of 
resolution, you can probably optimize your code to mix directly into the 
stream buffer.
* While fixing up all the sound cores I was VERY brute force in getting 
things to work. If you don't like what I did to your sound core, feel free 
to fix it up.


Sound core-specific changes
---------------------------

* ADPCM -- I removed this entirely and wired up dummy MSM5205s to most of 
the drivers still using it; these need to be revisited and fixed.
* AY8910 -- cleaned up the interface for the YM chips to access this.
* Custom -- many drivers using "custom" drivers were just using hard-coded 
samples and playing them with the (now-defunct) mixer. This is not "custom", 
it is "samples". They have been converted over to samples.
* Filter (volume) -- this is a new very simple filter that can be used to 
control the volume of a stream if you need an extra knob.
* Filter (RC) -- this is a new filter that replaces the old RC filter that 
was in the streams code. Eventually, this could get replaced by some simple 
discrete logic.
* IremGA20 -- Acho cod... transmission lost
* NES APU -- changed the way this worked so that it used streams properly 
instead of an update function.
* Samples -- there is now a start function that allows you to create your 
own custom samples if you want. This allows us to replace "custom" drivers 
with "samples" in several cases. There is a new call sample_start_raw() 
which lets you play a raw sample from a pointer to INT16 data.
* Votrax -- there was a dead Vortrax core that was still being 
hard-compiled. I pulled this out and made it a proper sound type (which 
currently isn't included).
* VRender0 -- fixed a clipping bug that was lurking there (negative clipping 
wrapped to positive values -- noticeable at 32-bits)
* YM2151 -- removed the alternate version and kept only Jarek's around. 
Having two cores was confusing and caused problems.
* YM2203/2608/2610 -- these chips now pass a set of functions into the FM 
core with pointers to all the AY8910-compatibility routines, rather than 
relying on global pointers.
* YMZ280B -- this code is just terrible now compared to when I first wrote 
it! :(

0.92

This release comes prior to some major changes to the sound system from Aaron.
Once Aaron has submitted his sound system changes 0.93 will be released to
allow for easy testing of them.

----

Fixed most of the remaining issues with Taito F3 sound [Nicola Salmoria]

	games not playable, but still a big improvement over the skeleton
	driver
	
Improvements to MACs driver [Tomasz Slanina]
	now using ST0016 Video, however emulation is still incomplete so

Improvements to Hyperstone based drivers [Tomasz Slanina]

Added missing PROMs to many drivers [HIGHWAYMAN]

Fixed Vs. Goonies Dips [chaneman]

Lethal Enforcers Improvements [R.Belmont]
	Fixes:
	- Tilemap colors
	- Guns hooked up and aligned properly
	- Tilemap and sprite layers aligned with the guns
	- Various other cleanups - added a sprite ROM that was missing previously

	To do:
	- Figure out the correct sprite decode
	- Sprite/tilemap priorities
	- "Reload" indicator is funky, probably needs tilemap
	flip bits.
	- Fix K056832 external linescroll RAM support (used
	for high scores, parallax in scrolling stages)

Misc Changes [Nathan Woods]
	src/cpu/g65816/g65816.h:
	src/cpu/g65816/g65816.c:
	src/cpu/g65816/g65816op.h:
	src/cpu/g65816/g65816cm.h:
	    - Added a hook that allows a driver to install a custom read handler 
	for reading interrupt vectors (the 65816 has a signal that is asserted 
	when reading a vector and certain hardware needs to reroute the read)

	src/memory.c:
	src/memory.h:
	    - Created a memory_get_op_ptr() call.  This call is equivalent to 
	memory_get_read_ptr() in ADDRESS_SPACE_PROGRAM with the exception that it is 
	aware of the opbase handler. 

	src/debug/debugcmd.c:
	src/debug/debugvw.c:
	   - Modified debugger to use memory_get_op_ptr() to determine if opcode 
	memory is unmapped. 
		
Misc compiler fixes [Lawrence Gold]

Taito SJ update [Nicola Salmoria]
	- added sound CPU -> main CPU communication (fixes Tin Star hangs without 
	need for a kludge, and makes tunes between levels correctly play until the 
	end)
	- added memory map derived from schematics
	- added DAC volume control (I hear little difference, even if it's used).
	- coin lockout (important otherwise games could accept more than 9 coins)

Correct Hyperstone Iram mirroring [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added real noise generator to TMS5110 [Jarek Burczynski]

Workaround for Dipswitch problem in Mr Do's Castle [Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed bug in M37710 cpu core [R.Belmont]

More Sega improvements, including lots of set renaming and cleaning up of drivers
by removing unused code [Aaron Giles]

Updated some mahjong drivers to use the new standard inputs [James Wallace]
	note, there was a further submission, this will need resyncing and
	resubmitting
	
PSX based driver improvments [smf]
	- new board notes from Guru
	- removed 8.3 restrictions on namco system 11 rom names
	- improved root counter emulation
	- improved dma acknowledge emulation
	- changes visible area immediately instead of during video update

Main purpose of this update is to clean up the compile warnings

--

Warning Cleanups [Nathan Woods, David Haywood]

ST-V update [Angelo Salese]
	-Added a kludge for Astra Super Stars to let it run past a nasty code,
	  nasty because I highly suspect it's a sh-2 bug,will be worked out in
	  the future.
	-Added some new vdp2 registers,for example the DISP one for avoid
	 transitions draws.
	-Re-added the layer disable/enable code that I sent in the past which
	 was lost,and removed the possibility to disable layers with non-debug
	 builds
	-Started to add default eeproms for the various games,for now I've hooked
	 up the one in Shienryu to let it run already with Vertical Switch.
	-Added the dynamic clocks,hopefully now 100% working.

TNZS driver update [Nicola Salmoria]
	- fixed crash due to code execution across bank cboundary (tnzs36b16yel)
	- removed kludges which were required to run Arkanoid 2 (they were just 
	mirror addresses)
	- added sprite banking (same as seta.c). Insecotr X and other were obvoisly 
	running at 30fps before, now they are ok. Also fixes insectx13b16gre and 
	insectx236b16gre.
	- added sprite buffering (not quite the same as seta.c). Fixes kabukiz 
	sprites and backgrounds, though there might still be a few glitches.
	- fixed kabukiz sound

Correct NeoGeo Mirroring + additional information on coin counters etc. [Razoola]

Lethal Enforcers updates [Nicola Salmoria, R.Belmont]

==========================================================================

0.91u1

This has been released quickly after 0.91 due to a bug left in the Memory System.
I consider core bugs critical and prefer to see them fixed in official updates as
soon as possible.

	  registers and RAM (evil!).
	- Removed hack to pass POST since we now do it the right way
	- Corrected 56832 RAM interface, added preliminary support for external
	  linescroll RAM on the 56832.  This helps with the garbage tilemaps a bit
	  since linescroll data is no longer getting sprayed all over VRAM.
	  
	  (note, with this update the driver was just crashing when I tested it,
	   so maybe something is wrong)

NEC disassembler update [Bryan McPhail]
	Added support for encrypted opcodes in i386 disassembler (for Irem games).
	Added some of the NEC V series instructions into i386 disassembler

	Improved decryption logic
	Added complete table for Enduro Racer
	Added more data to Super Hang On Table

Increased the amount of adjustable memory banks from 24 to 32. [Nathan Woods]

ST-V Update [Angelo Salese]

	-Started to work with the A-Bus protection,it is a sort of data transfer with the
	 cartridge area,more info in the stv.c file.
	 Current implementation just fixes character selection screens in sss,I will work out
	 about this one in the future,it has various "interesting" issues which was thought
	 to be emulation probs(i.e booting in rsgun,textures in elandore etc.).
	
	-Added a preliminary timer 1 irq handling,it fixes pblbeach booting but it doesn't
	 work yet because of incomplete VDP-1 emulation.
	
	-Noticed that ignoring VDP-1 long word access read by SH-2 isn't correct and not
	 needed (because sss is protected rather than using an illegal procedure),it was
	 causing wrong graphics in fhboxers & boot errors in pblbeach,reversed it back to
	 default.

Added missing Player 2 controls to Space War (Leijac) [Steve Ellenoff]	

Pacman Driver Update [Dave Widel]
	Sets added:
	
	jumpshtp: prototype from PokeMAME
	vanvanb:  bootleg but it looks earlier.
	sprglobp: Not sure if this is the official set, or an accidental merged set with
	          the glob.
	ctrpllrp: I consider this sig. since it came in it's own cab, and they did change
	          some of the music.

	Other changes:
	
	Added full memory map, this should fix the ending of Ms Pac.
	Added a jumpshot dip.
	I didn't remove any sets, but I mentioned which of them are junk imo and why.

	  another map.
	* tidied up the mirroring in the S2650 games.
	* grouped the GAME() lines by hardware and then year.
	* moved jrpacmbl back into pengo.c

Minor Debugger Fix [Nathan Woods]
	Removed the VK_HOME and VK_END cases for the WM_KEYDOWN event.  As far as I can
	tell, the default action does the trick, and additionally, Shift+Home and
	Shift+End are also handled correctly. 

Added standard set of Mahjong Inputs [Aaron Giles]

Arcadia Update [Mariusz Wojcieszek]
	- changed driver to use multi bios setup
	- added support for TenPlay bios (from 10 games board)
	- added proper Kickstart 1.3 image (256k instead of 512k)

	- fixed garbage graphics on startup with a kludge (othunder074u1gre)
	- also fixed wrong plane graphics at the end of the game (othunder074u1gre3) 
	  but I have no idea how! I completed the game three times and it's not doing 
	  it anymore.

Tilemap Update [Aaron Giles]
	Added a user_data field for tilemaps. You can call tilemap_set_user_data() to
	set this field internally in the tilemaps. Before  rendering, this value will
	be copied into the (new) global  tile_info.user_data field, so that your
	tilemap callback can use it

Kaneko update in preparation for data from Blood Warriors [Sebastien Volpe]

Preliminary decryption of Shisensho II [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
	note: still being worked on

Erotictac driver update [Tomasz Slanina]

	computer out of src/machine/amiga.c into callbacks.  This allowed me to 
	get rid of all #ifdef MESS code out of src/machine/amiga.c

ST-V updates [Angelo Salese]
	-Fixed a bug with the VDP-1 ram reading,
	 SH-2 can do byte or word access, it's implicit that can't do long word access.
	 This fixes the Steep Slope Sliders booting so the game now works.
	-VDP-1 PTM's "draw by request" was actually causing sprites to flicker in
	 kiwames,reversed back to old implementation until I or somebody else understand
	 what the current issue is (clear_framebuffer?)
	-Finished the game header update,let me know if you like/don't like the system
	 used for the description of the games.
	-fixed a ST-V visible area incorrectness which was causing Virtual Mahjong 2 to
	 crash after the sound ram check
	-fixed a window effect bug in Double-density interlace mode,this fixes some
	 graphics in vmahjong & myfairld.
	-Guessed a bitmap positioning issue in double-density interlace mode,this fixes
	 the NBG1 positioning in myfairld.
	-My Fair Lady now works but only with sound disabled.I have not removed the
	 NOT_WORKING status due to that.

New Sound Functionality [Derrick Renaud]
	Took Frank Palazzolo's DISCRETE_FILTER2 code and made it work outside of the
	discrete system.
	See sound\filter.h for new functions.

0.90u1

Thanks to Pierpaolo Prazzoli (Reip) for putting together the 0.90 release while I was away

General Improvements
--------------------

FD1089 decryption [Nicola Salmoria, Charles MacDonald]
	- 100% accurate emulation of FD1089A, FD1089B should be considered 99% 
	because it will have to be verified with other CPUs (it is 100% for all 
	currently supported games).

	- complete tables provided by Charles MacDonald for 317-0018 (Action 
	Fighter), 317-0022 (Dunk Shot), 317-0168 (Aurail).

	- partial tables derived by comparison with the unencrypted versions for 
	Enduro Racer, Alex Kidd, 317-0024 (Time Scanner), 317-0033 (Alien Syndrome, 
	3 versions), 317-0027 (SDI). (actual working cpus are needed to obtain full
	tables)

	* dunkshot graphics correct, controls hooked up
	* sdioj controls hooked up
	* timescna sprites fixed
	* shangona, shangnle now playable
	* toutrun road fixed
	* all memory mapping code unified and moved into machine/segaic16.c
	* all tilemap, sprite, and road code unified and moved into 
	  vidhrdw/segaic16.c
	* improved documentation on the various register layouts on the video side

	Note that in the process, I broke the title screen animation for Laser 
	Ghost, and there is now a 1-pixel column error on ddcrew's attract mode. 
	These are known issues that I will try to address soon.

 - fixed pbillian MCU simulation and inputs
 - improved hotsmash MCU simulation, the game is playable now though still incomplete.

Bubble Bobble driver update [Nicola Salmoria]

0.89u6

General Improvements
--------------------

MC8193 update [Nicola Salmoria]
	- expanded the decryption tables, they change when bit 15 of the address is 
	  set
	- table for 317-0066 (Altered Beast) almost complete, but there are still 
	  some uncertain values for opcodes above 8000 (not actually needed)
	- incomplete table for 317-0054 (Shinobi). Still not enough to decrypt the 
	  program.
	- tables for 317-0043 (wbml) and ninjakd2 derived by comparison of the 
	  original with the decrypted bootleg. They are incomplete but enough to fully 
	  decrypt the program. Unfortunately Block Gal and Perfect Billiards cannot be 
	  done in the same way because encrypted and decrypted programs are different 
	  versions.

i386 fixes [Nathan Woods]
	src/cpu/i386/i386dasm.c:
   	- disassembler will now list segment prefixes when appropriate

	src/cpu/i386/i386op16.c:
	- fixed LMSW opcode

New Sega X-Board driver [Aaron Giles]
	many improvements over the old driver
	
	-- improved sprites (see thunderblade)
	-- improved road layer (see abcop, thunderblade)
	-- guns in line of fire (but it hangs at the end of the level)
	-- better tilemap support (from 16b)
	
	-- gprider no longer boots (nested interrupts)

	- Fixed disassembler calls, so that instructions are not falsely 
	disassembled as 32-bit

	src/cpu/i386/i386op16.c:
	- Implemented SMSW instruction
    
	src/cpu/i386/i386dasm.c:
	- Marked retf instruction as DASMFLAG_STEP_OUT
	
	src/x86drc.h:
	- Added macros for pushfd() and popfd()

Added 'TRACEOVER' support to debugger (see help) [Nathan Woods]

New Debugger Commands [Aaron Giles]
	- snap [<filename>] - takes a snapshot and saves it to the given <filename>; 
	if <filename> is omitted, this is equivalent to hitting F12
	- gi[int] [<irqline>] - executes until the current CPU takes the interrupt 
	line specified by <irqline>; if <irqline> is omitted, executes until any IRQ 
	is taken on the current CPU. This has been mapped to F7 as well.
	- gv[blank] - executes until the next VBLANK; this is useful for stepping 
	frame-by-frame from within the debugger. This has been mapped to F8.

Various Improvements [Sebastien Volpe]

	galpani3:
	- palette, inputs, sound hooked up, backgounds 'decoded' (RLE)

	jchan:
	- slight cleanup, sound hooked up, tile area identified
	- jchan2 now passes initial checks

Sega Improvements [Aaron Giles]

	Sega System 16A:
	* included detailed readme in the driver file
	* hooked up column/row scroll (see quartet title screen) -- don't know if 
	it's really right yet
	* reintroduced tilemap/text priorities
	* corrected Z80 clock speed
	* incorporated Brian Troha's updated DIPs
	* minor cleanups
	
	Sega System 16B:
	* fixed ROM bank mapping so it doesn't fall through to unmapped handlers
	* incorporatedBrian Troha's updated DIPs
	* minor cleanups
	* fixed column scroll after talking to Charles about how it 
	works
	
	Sega System 18:
	* fixed ROM bank mapping so it doesn't fall through to unmapped handlers
	  (fixes Shadow Dancer crash)
	* expanded memory mapping code so it works from the 8751 as well as the 
	68000
	* hooked up the 8751 in mwalk/mwalka/mwalkb -- these all work now
	* removed coin lockouts as they were breaking several games' coin inputs
	* hooked up Laser Ghost controls and added crosshair drawing (not 100% yet, 
	feel free to tweak)
	* hooked up Where's Wally controls
	* fixed astorm's Player 3 controls
	* cleaned up ddcrew's inputs
	* fixed sound ROM loading in astorma/astorm2p/mwalk*
	* incorporated Brian Troha's updated DIPs
	* minor cleanups
	* added sprite masking effect used by Where's Wally
	* fixed column scroll after talking to Charles about how it 
	works (ddcrew attract mode scrolls properly now)
	* went through and fixed VDP priorities in all S18 games; everything should 
	be correct now, let me know if you find anything not right
	
Fixed i8051 cpu core bugs [Aaron Giles]
	uses correct read/write memory routines for external accesses
	support for external IRQs

Fixed an rf5c68 memory access bug [Aaron Giles]

Improvements to Hyper Crash [Angelo Salese]
	now mostly working apart from controls and a gfx glitch on the player car
	
More Taito F2 Blending Improvements [Bryan McPhail]
	Added the TC0360PRI blending modes to the games with rotation layers.  This
	includes Pulirula & Liquid Kids.  One of the blending modes is new to these
	games (not used in Gun Frontier) and I have no way to verify it's actually
	correct - someone with a working board will need to verify (Liquid Kids -fish
	going in water in attract mode, Pulirula - crystals on level 2).
	
Fixed colours in Flower [Bryan McPhail]

Modified Frogs driver to only use samples when actually needed [Derrick Renaud]

General Improvements
--------------------

Misc. Sega Improvements
	Improved inputs in DDCrew, all 4 players can now be used, although only
	the service coin works. [David Haywood]

	Hooked up Nitro button in Turbo Outrun [smf]

	Improved GPRider Sound [R.Belmont]

	Fixed Cotton, Turbo Outrun filenames [deadscreem]

	Fixed Thunderblade filenames
	
Namco System 1 update [Nicola Salmoria]

	- added a new function tilemap_draw_primask(). This takes an additional 
	parameter, which is ANDed with the contents of priority_bitmap before ORing 
	it with the specified priority. Essentially, the old tilemap_draw() is 
	equivalent to tilemap_draw_pribuffer(..., 0xff). The two should probably be 
	unified. This new handling of priority_bitmap allows a more intuitive 
	handling of pdrawgfx(), and more layers to be used (up to 31, instead of 
	just 5 - Namco S1 needed 8).
	NOTE: to implement this change, I had to disable the asm optimized routines 
	PDT16 and PDO16 in windows/oslinline.h. If they are useful for performance, 
	they should be updated and reenabled.
	
	- fixed sprite handling and removed all the nonsense hacks from the video 
	update
	- made sprite/tilemap priorities orthogonal (not sure if it was needed).
	- also updated System 86 (which uses the same sprite hardware) to the latest 
	code. Curiously, this introduces sprite/sprite priority issues in Wonder 
	Momo. I'm puzzled by this.
	- vastly improved the key custom emulation, shrinking it down to three basic 
	types. This also fixed issues with pistoldm (e.g. bomb explosions, and other 
	random events).
	- pistoldm061yel
	- fixed DAC sounds in berabohm and faceoff, two sounds at the same time were 
	causing severe slowdowns.
	- fixed Namco logo in Dangerous Seed
	- cleaned up input ports, using PORT_INCLUDE
	- found some more debug dip switches
	- dspirit061gre
	- added support for visibility window, this fixes countless issues with 
	partial video updates and the intro of Rompers
	- namcosx36rc2gre
	- fixed berabohm inputs
	- better ROM loading, closer to the hardware (though it uses more memory)
	- toggling the test mode dip switch is enough to enter test mode - no need 
	to reset
	- removed the galaga88 set: it was a hacked version removing the key custom 
	checks and disabling ROM checksum tests
	- cleaned up the CUS30 wavedata/sound command/RAM interface, put it all in a 
	single function
	- splatter061gre: I don't think this is a bug
	- splatter061gre2: I don't think this is a bug, just dark brown would look 
	black on an arcade monitor
	- splatter061gre3: please verify if this still applies / I don't think it is 
	a bug
	- splatter061gre4: please verify if this still applies
	- namcos1c070u5gre: I don't think this is a bug, attract mode plays back a 
	few seconds from the last game played. In bootup, there is no previous game, 
	so no demo play. I agree it's awkward, though.


Discrete Sound Update [Derrick Renaud]

	Discrete Sound Changes
	======================
	* Modified Discrete core node inputs to use pointers to the data, instead of
	moving the data into the inputs at each step.  This speeds up discrete emulation.
	* modified all current modules and drivers to use new code.


	New Discrete Modules Added
	==========================
	* DISCRETE_555_ASTABL has been modified to remove control voltage support.
	  DISCRETE_555_ASTABL_CV has been added if control voltage is used.


	Game Driver Changes
	===================
	* frogs-  Removed discrete tongue sound for now.  Added sample support.
	The buzz sound of flys is constant because it can't be emulated properly until
	full discrete support is added.  Samples are from the ones posted by Twisty.


New games marked as GAME_NOT_WORKING

==========================================================================

0.88u7

General Improvements
--------------------

Many improvements to Sega System Pre16,16a,16b,18 drivers [Aaron Giles]
	Drivers cleaned up
	
	Most known video issues are now fixed
	Alien Storm, DDCrew, Clutch Hitter, Laser Ghost, Cotton and
	many others have greatly improved video.
	
	Alien Storm is fully playable
	
	DD Crew is fully playable but requires inputs to be fixed
	 (currently only service coin and controls for 1 player work)
	
	Laser Ghost would probably be playable if the controls were
	correctly hooked up

	Moonwalker requires improvements to the MCU emulation
	
	We will now accept bug reports at Mametesters.org for any games
	running on the following drivers
		segas16a.c, segas16b.c, segas18.c
	Most of the bootlegs are still running on system16.c, please do
	not report bugs for these, nor for outrun or afterburner hardware.

Added other hyperstone models, converted vamphalf driver to use 16-bit version [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]


Discrete Sound Update [Derrick Renaud]

	Discrete Sound Changes
	======================
	* Removed the memory mapping system from the discrete inputs.  It served no
	purpose and was never functional.  It only added a layer of confusion to the
	code by forcing it's use on all current drivers that do not need it.  If
	memory mapped inputs are needed in the future (not likely), then they can be
	added with a DISCRETE_INPUT_MAP function.
	* Now the discrete inputs are written to by their node name only.
	  eg: discrete_sound_w(NODE_xx, data)
	* DISCRETE_INPUT and DISCRETE_INPUTX have been removed in favour of new
	easier to use input modules.
	* modified all current drivers to use new code.
	* moved discrete sound code from drivers and put in sndhrdw\
	
	New Discrete Modules Added
	==========================
	* DISCRETE_INPUT_DATA(node)  - accepts 8-bit data from discrete_sound_w.
	Output at reset is 0.
	* DISCRETE_INPUT_LOGIC(node) - 0 if data=0; 1 if data=!0.  Output at reset
	is 0.
	* DISCRETE_INPUT_NOT(node)   - 0 if data=!0; 1 if data=0.  Output at reset
	is 1.
	
	* DISCRETE_INPUTX_DATA(node, gain, offset, init)
	* DISCRETE_INPUTX_LOGIC(node, gain, offset, init)
	* DISCRETE_INPUTX_NOT(node, gain, offset, init)
	                             - same as above, but will modify the output by the
	                               given GAIN and OFFSET.  At reset the output will
	                               be INIT modified by GAIN and OFFSET.
	
	Game Driver Changes
	===================
	* skydiver -  added proper watchdog.  Merged memory map and added proper
	mirroring.  Fixed coin input bug skydiver078u3yel.  It's not a 100% accurate
	fix, but will work until I get the exact interrupt time.  The current
	interrupt time was 100% off.  It is now less then 25% off.  :-)
	
	
Windows Debugger Updates
------------------------

Fixed some compile errors [Nathan Woods]

Misc updates [Aaron Giles]
* Added a "PC" register to the I386 core so that it should work in the new debugger
* Cleaned up stepping code
* Now refresh the display and all debugger windows after each step while stepping
* When running with the debugger window open (F5 or 'go'), now update the debugger views
4 times per second
* Can now break into the debugger even if you are focused on a debugger window
* Memory/disasm windows now come up with the currently active CPU selected by default
* added a new command: focus <cpunum>, which is equivalent to ignoring all 
other CPUs
* changed ignore and observe to support multiple parameters so you can say "ignore 2,3,4"
* changed ignore so that you are not allowed to ignore the last CPU
* fixed ignore behavior so that other CPUs are truly ignored
* fixed register window so that change hilights are maintained during scrolling and updates
* changed debug memory accessors so they don't log on invalid memory accesses
* tweaked the help text to indicate that help <command> works
* added a new text attribute DCA_CURRENT, which is separate from DCA_SELECTED -- the main
visible difference is that the memory view editing cursor is now hilighted red instead of
yellow

In-line memory editing is now supported. To do this, I added a generic 
cursor concept to the view system. Each view can handle it however they 
want. Right now only the memory view supports a cursor. [Aaron Giles]

Click in the memory view to place the cursor. Type over nibbles with 0-F, or 
use the arrow keys to navigate around. Tab cycles between the edit box and 
the memory editor. [Aaron Giles]

updated psx core to show more registers [smf]

Jr Pacman driver cleanups [Aaron Giles]

New Windows based debugger [Aaron Giles]  
----------------------------------------

Note: The new debugger is enabled as the default debugger for the next few u
releases (in a debug build only) to allow feedback, it can be disabled by
changing the makefile

(description of 1st update)

There are some new behaviors and new ways of doing things you should be 
aware of. By default the debugger no longer "auto hides". This was a remnant 
of the way the old debugger worked that I have gotten rid of. If you want to 
hide all the debugger windows, just close the "main" debug window. It will 
return if you break in the debugger at a future time.

The "main" window has four panes: a register list on the left, a disassembly 
around the current PC at the top, a console output window in the middle, and 
an input line at the bottom. The input line supports full editing features, 
and you can also use up arrow/down arrow to cycle through recently typed 
commands.

Hitting Enter on a blank line in the console is equivalent to single 
stepping once. You can also do that with F11. To run, either use the "go" 
command or hit F12 (or close the "main" window). To run until the next CPU, 
either use the "next" command or hit F6.

You can bring up multiple independent memory and/or disassembly windows by 
using the Debug menu. Each window can look at a different address space on 
any CPU. You can enter any expression (including those using registers from 
the CPU) into the entry line at the top of these windows in order to specify 
which address to begin displaying at.

I've implemented a number of useful commands in the console. Type "help" to 
navigate the extensive online documentation for a number of examples on how 
to use these features. You can do some really cool stuff now with the 
conditional watchpoints and breakpoints.

This is a work-in-progress, but it's pretty good now (IMHO) and stable for 
common debugging operations. Let me know what you like/dislike about it and 
what sorts of features you feel are still lacking.

(description of 2nd update)

F12 now means "run and hide the debugger". I found this was too useful to 
get rid of entirely.
F5 just means "run", keeping the debugger visible.

Enabling the debugger now forces window mode and prevents you from switching 
to full screen mode.

(description of 3rd update)

* Added step over/step out functionality. F10 or "over" steps over an 
instruction. Shift+F11 or "out" steps out of a subroutine or exception 
handler. Note that this feature relies on the disassembler to produce some 
flags indicating which instructions which need to be stepped over (generally 
CALLs and TRAPs) and which instructions end a step out search (generally 
RETURNs).
* Modified the 680x0 and MIPS3 disassemblers to support these features.
* Changed the disassembly view to back up 3 instructions when resetting 
(that is, the current PC should appear on the 4th line instead of the 1st 
line). This is not perfect, but works pretty well overall and should help 
see the previous couple of instructions when, say, a watchpoint is hit.
* Improved filtering of keypresses so that they don't leak into the game 
when you are typing in the debugger.

General Improvements
--------------------

Further improvements to the FD1094 decryption, this is now almost fully understood,
additional FD1094 cpus are needed to work out the remaining details.  Keys are now

	urashima/mjzoomin/daireika,with wrong colors(data is extracted from MCU
	code) and wrong tilemap positioning(these games uses the RANGE
	register,which needs further investigation).

General Improvements
--------------------

Emulation of Sega FD1094 encrypted 68k CPUs, this will allow for significant progress
in the emulation of the remaining encrypted Sega games.  Note that we require working
CPUs to extract encryption data from in order to emulate the encrypted titles, see
http://cgfm2.emuviews.com/ for more details.  As a result of this code several of the
encrypted games will now boot (astorm, ddcrew, wb3a, wb3b, tetris, ddux, sonicbom etc.)
	[Charles MacDonald - extracting data from CPUs,
	  Nicola Salmoria - decryption code]

	- Updated game status listing

Fixed some c99 related compiler issues [Jeff Mitchell, Lawrence Gold]

update to ppmast93 driver, still not playable [David Haywood]

Discrete sound changes [Derrick Renaud]

	Discrete Sound Changes
	======================
	* Continued cleanup of code to make it more readable

	New Discrete Modules Added
	==========================
	* DISCRETE_NOTE - counter circuit used to create tones/music.
	* DISCRETE_INTEGRATE - various op amp integration (ramp) circuits.
	* DISCRETE_OP_AMP_TRIG_VCA - Did not know what to call this. :-)  Basically it
	is a programable voltage controlled amp.  But uses only an on/off trigger.  It
	has resistors to select the rise/fall times.  Also it is not a true VCA.  It
	actually adjusts amplitude by clipping more/less off the bottom of the input
	signal.  But it is a common circuit.
	
	Game Driver Changes
	===================
	* polaris - complete sound rewrite to use new component value code.  Hooked up
	watchdog timer.

New watchdog functionality [Derrick Renaud]

	Game Driver Changes
	===================
	* dominos, sprint1, sprint2, dragrace, canyon, nitedrvr - added watchdog and
	set to proper time using new MDRV_WATCHDOG_VBLANK_INIT function.
	* firetrk, montecar, superbug, pacman, polaris - changed watchdog to proper
	time using new MDRV_WATCHDOG_VBLANK_INIT function.
	* galpania, galpanib - changed to MDRV_WATCHDOG_VBLANK_INIT because these
	games need watchdog init at game start.
	
	Core Changes
	============
	Changed watchdog to allow it to start at machine run start.  If not used, the
	previous watchdog functionality is retained.  Only define 1 of the 2 watchdogs
	per game.  If both are defined then  MDRV_WATCHDOG_VBLANK_INIT will be used
	only.
	
	* MDRV_WATCHDOG_VBLANK_INIT(watch_count)- Initializes the watchdog in
	MACHINE_DRIVER_.  watch_count is the # of vertical blanking intervals before a
	forced reset.  If the time is unkown then you can use these defaults:
	DEFAULT_60HZ_3S_VBLANK_WATCHDOG or DEFAULT_30HZ_3S_VBLANK_WATCHDOG
	
	* MDRV_WATCHDOG_TIME_INIT(time)- Initializes the watchdog in MACHINE_DRIVER_.
	time is the time in seconds before a forced reset.
	
	New function to enable/disable the watchdog in game.
	watchdog_enable(0 or 1) - used to 0=disable or !0=enable.
	
	Made a macro that calculates the pulse time of a 74LS122 or LS123.
	TIME_OF_74LS123(r,c)
	r is in Ohms.  c is in Farads.
	c must be greater then 1000pF to use this function
	

Added runtime option to disable validity checks [Derrick Renaud]

	Added run time option:
	-[no]skip_validitychecks
	    Forces MAME to skip doing the code validity checks. The default is
	    OFF (-noskip_validitychecks).
	This new option will default to doing the test and force you to confirm you
	do not want to use it.  This way users can test their submissions easily and
	then speed things up when confirmed ok.
	
	NOTE: DO NOT disable the checks when submitting code

Fixed voodoo code broken by cleanup in u3 [Aaron Giles]

Fixed qdrmfgp broken by cleanup in u3 [Olivier Galibert]

Fixed cut and paste error in chdman [Ren Single]

Fixed mayday inputs [Stefan Jokisch]

Fixed Puzzle Club dips [Brian Troha]

Input Port System Update [Aaron Giles]
	PORT_INCLUDE() works the same as before.

	PORT_MODIFY("tag") allows you to modify any given input port by specifying 
	its tag.

	Any PORT_BIT() entries that you put after a PORT_MODIFY will nuke any 
	matching entries in the previous definition, allowing you to overwrite them 
	with new stuff.
	
	I also added a few new functions:
	
	readinputportbytag_safe() takes a tag and a default value. If the tag is not 
	found, the default value is returned.
	
	port_tag_to_handler8()
	port_tag_to_handler16()
	port_tag_to_handler32() -- these 3 new functions take a tag string, find the 
	input port, and return the appropriate handler. They can be used in AM_READ, 
	so instead of:
	
	  AM_RANGE(0x00, 0x00) AM_READ(input_port_1_r)
	
	You can use
	
	  AM_RANGE(0x00, 0x00) AM_READ(port_tag_to_handler8("MyPortName"))

	I've modified exidy.c to use these features as a testbed. Let me know if you 
	see any problems.

Memory system changes / fixes [Aaron Giles]
	* added explicit casting to the memory handler width when computing the 
	shifted data/mask values for read/write handlers -- this should in theory 
	fix R. Belmont's 64-bit issues

	* added memory_install_read/write8/16/32/64_matchmask_handler functions to 
	allow dynamic installation of match/mask (AM_SPACE-style) memory ranges --  
	this should satisfy Frank P's request for the astrocade driver
	
	* changed masking behavior for match/mask pairs so that an AM_SPACE with an 
	AM_MASK does not expand the explicitly-specified mask value -- this should 
	fix dwidel's problem getting Pac-Man accurate
	
	* changed dynamic bank assignment to always assign a bank if you have 
	explicitly specified a mask value via AM_MASK -- this should allow mirroring 
	via AM_MASK if you want to, though AM_MIRROR is still preferred
	
Fixed OKI banking in Fixeight bootleg [Quench]

More changes [Derrick Renaud]

	Game Driver Changes
	===================
	* firetrk, montecar - added proper CPU clock frequency change when going
	in/out of service mode.
	
	Core Changes
	============
	Fixed some last remaining issues with the new watchdog.  The watchdog would
	not remain disabled after a watchdog_enable(0) in some conditions.

	Added a new function to change CPU clock speed in game.  The current scaling
	factor will still apply.  eg. If you force the CPU to change clock to 1MHz
	while the scaling is at 50%, the effective CPU speed will be 500kHz.  Then
	reading the clock speed will give 1MHz, because clock scaling is transparent
	to the driver.

	/* Returns the current CPU's actual unscaled running clock speed */
	int cpunum_get_clock(int cpunum);

	/* Sets the current CPU's clock speed and then adjusts for scaling */
	void cpunum_set_clock(int cpunum, int clock);

Changed instr86.c based on comment below:
In the cpu/i86 code emulating the CMPSW instruction there is what seems to
be a cut+paste bug: It calls the SUBB() macro where it should call SUBW().
Line 524 of instr86.c.

0.87u3

General Improvements
--------------------

Exidy Games update [Aaron Giles]
	This update is mainly a bunch of cleanup on the classic Exidy drivers. The 
	memory maps are merged now, and I've gone through and removed a bunch of RAM 
	that wasn't actually present on the real boards. I also fixed up the input 
	ports on several of the bootlegs.

Cinematronics Vector driver update [Aaron Giles]
	* completely rewrote the CCPU core to be much simpler and follow MAME 
	semantics
	* rewrote the CCPU disassembler to use the "official" syntax
	* added newly dug-up prototype game QB-3
	* now require the CCPU PROMs for all the games
	* added sound to Barrier, Star Hawk, War of the Worlds, and Boxing Bugs 
	(note that samples don't exist yet, but I'm working with Zonn Moore to get 
	them for everything except Barrier)
	* rewrote sound routines for all the games based on schematics and Zonn's 
	documentation
	* fixed sound in Demon (was seriously wrong)
	* changed sound handling in Solar Quest to play the music by looping a 
	square wave instead of using canned samples
	* added 64-level support for Solar Quest
	* added proper color support for Boxing Bugs and War of the Worlds
	* added star twinkle effects (not really visible without my future update to 
	vector.c)
	* made wotw the black & white hardware which was commonly seen as a Star 
	Castle upgrade
	* added wotwc as the color hardware version (same ROMs)
	* cleaned up and fixed input ports for all the games

Namco IC update [Phil Stroffolino]
	Fixes to the advanced ROZ chip used by System FL, Namco NB2, and some Namco System 2
	games.  Huge improvements to Mach Breakers, and game specific ROZ hacks have been removed.

	Fixes for the ROZ system used in older System2 games; in particular Dragon Blade glitches
	are no more.

	Abstraction for the tilemap system used in many Namco titles.

	Merged memory maps.

	The ROZ fixes unfortunately use a handful of custom code, to work around limitations of
	tilemap.c's roz support.  I'll improve tilemap.c when I get a chance.

Improvements to jalmah.c [Angelo Salese]

Improvements to sound in recalh and intcup94 [David Haywood]

==========================================================================

0.87u2

i960 updates [R.Belmont]
	- Added spanbit
	- Fixed error noted by ElSemi in spanbit and scanbit
	- Added non-queued interrupts to support games with
	the interrupt table in ROM (this fixes the colors and
	hanging in Sky Target, and Pilot Kids will need it
	too)
	- Added the ability for read/write handlers to declare
	themselves "noburst", for memory regions which don't
	auto-increment the address on i960 bulk transfers
	- General cleanup of the interrupt handling to remove
	duplicated code.  There should be no functional
	difference

model2 updates [R.Belmont]
	- Properly mapped 'unplaced' ROMs for Daytona and
	Desert Tank
	- Added calls to i960 noburst support for the timer
	and interrupt control registers
	- Updated game status with latest knowledge
	- Noted that Last Bronx boots now
	- VF2 reparent: 2.1 is parent, ver. B and original are
	children
	- SHA1s for lastbexp, doa, and pltkids
	- Removed unnecessary code patch from DOA
	- Added Martin Marietta co-credit for Desert Tank
	- Added EPL Productions co-credit for Behind Enemy
	Lines
	- "Sonic Championship" renamed to "Sonic The Fighters"
	- Virtual On is "Cyber Troopers" (two words) on the
	title screen, not "Cybertroopers"
	- Zero Gunner changed from (Jap) to (Japan)
	- Mapped framebuffer RAM (used by Last Bronx)
	- Fixed non-32 bit writes to the interrupt registers
	- Fixed serial hardware mapping
	- Temporary hack to keep HOTD from freezing until I
	properly implement the timers
	- Split the 2O/2A/2B/2C drivers better.  von now
	prints "MODEL 2BCRX" correctly
	- Hack to make Last Bronx run while I track down an
	i960 core bug that's haunting it
	- Patch from ElSemi for Zero Gunner crashing
	- Patched Daytona busywait for the TGPs (not sure how
	it worked without this before)
	- Fixed 68000 ROM load for skytargt
	- Fixed thinko in the interrupt register handling
	(still no help for Last Bronx, but the wrong way was
	definitely hurting it worse)
	- Fixed issue on big-endian machines
	- Added framework so the DSP program uploads are now
	handled correctly
	
C352 Pitch adjustment [R.Belmont, Cap]

Analog Port Fixes [Derrick Renaud]
	downtown - Both analog controls were set to player 1.
	eterm - Crashed, due to inc/dec buttons not being defined for the analog
	ports.
	
Now loading sync prom in Atari Soccer [Stefan Jokisch]

Added eeprom and flipscreen to the games in vamphalf driver [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Improved sound in Hard Head / Popper [Pierpaolo Prazzoli, Corrado Tomaselli]

Misc updates [Nathan Woods]
	src/mame.c:
	    - Created a MAME_VALIDITYCHECKS macro that when defined, can specify 
	whether validity checks should be run.  If undefined, it defaults to 
	running the validity checks.  This will facilitate turning off validity 
	checks in MAME derivative projects.
	
	Please DO NOT turn these off if you are making changes to the Mame
	source, any changes which fail the validity checks will be rejected.

	src/windows/fronthlp.c:
	    - Changed the stat() call to use Win32 equivalents.
	    
Fixed some Compiler Warnings [Lawrence Gold]

	i.e after the first two trials), zeroes don't appear at all.


General Improvements
--------------------

Minor Compiler fixes [Brad Oliver]

Removed options.color_depth (obsolete anyway) [Brad Oliver]

Compiler Fixes for VC [Bryan McPhail]
	src\drivers\suprgolf.c		- C99 fix
	src\cpu\m37710\m37710op.h	- Fixed warnings under VC
	src\cpu\powerpc\ppc.c		- Fixed warnings under VC
	src\cpu\powerpc\ppc403.c	- Fixed warnings under VC

Added default eeprom to Recalhorn to prevent crash [Bryan McPhail]

Modified tilemap.c so roz and RGB_DIRECT can be used together [Andrew Gardner]

Fixed I/O addresses in Hyperstone and so removed the hack from vamphalf
driver [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Yumefuda update (eeprom etc.) [Gondos, Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

fixed some gfx in tmmjprd [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

i960 updates [R.Belmont]
	- Added support for the following opcodes: nor, addc,
	subc, atanr, sinr, cosr, tanr, atanrl, logrl, sinrl,
	cosrl, and tanrl.
	- Added those and some others to the disassembler.
	- Added parens for the compiler warning.
	- Fixed stt to only store 3 words instead of 4.
	- Added logepr and cvtri.
	- Fixed cmpr and cmprl - they were comparing garbage
	instead of the correct registers.
	- Added disassembly for movrl.
	- Added scanbit.
	- Rewrote flushreg, it was *totally* wrong before. 
	HOTD now runs, among others.
	- Added hack to divo so divide by zero doesn't crash
	MAME (some games read back 0 from the not-yet-existing
	DSP and do this).
	- More disassembler improvements.
	- Added NAND, EDIV, SCALER, SCALERL, ROUNDR, ROUNDRL,
	EXPRL, MOVRE, and CPYSRE opcodes.
	- Fixed some errors in interrupt handling.  Solves
	corrupt graphics in fvipers and crashes in fvipers,
	schamp, and dynamcop.
	- Added REMR opcode.

SegaIC24 update [R.Belmont]
	Add 32-bit access methods for char and tile RAM.

Grand Champion sound fix [Justin Szczap]

INP changes [Barry Rodewald]
	Basically, reading/writing analog port data every single time
	interpolate_analog_port() isn't a good idea, especially since it's called
	every time readinputport() is.  I've just moved the analogue port
	reading/writing into the for loop, so analogue ports are only read/written
	if the port is actually is analogue. 

Dynagears dip fix [Derrick Renaud]

ZN1/ZN2 big endian fix [smf]

SPI decryption improvements (for rf2_2k) [Ville Linde]


New clones supported or promoted from GAME_NOT_WORKING status

Painted Lady (Splash) (Ver 1.3 US) [Manuel Abadia]

New games marked as GAME_NOT_WORKING
------------------------------------
Tatsumi Driver [Bryan McPhail]
	playable to a degree, but not really working properly

	Apache 3
	Round Up 5
	Cycle Warriors

	Incredibly complex hardware!  These are all different boards, but share
	a similar sprite chip (TZB215 on Apache 3, TZB315 on others).  Other
	graphics (road, sky, bg/fg layers) all differ between games.

	Todo:
		Sprite rotation
		Finish road layer (Round Up 5)
		Implement road layer (Apache 3, Cycle Warriors)
		BG layer(s) (Cycle Warriors)
		BG layer (Round Up 5) - May be driven by missing VRAM data
		Round Up 5 always boots with a coin inserted
		Round Up 5 doesn't survive a reset
		Dip switches
		Various other things..

Sega Model 2 Driver [R.Belmont]
	(see model2.c for list of games)
	Tilemaps, sound, and inputs working to varying degrees

Small update to the Kaneko drivers [Sebastien Volpe]
	- correct dipswitches for bonkadv
	- galpanib protection moved to machine\kaneko16.c, and sandscrp uses it
	- merged read/write memory maps for the 3 galpanic sets

Support 16 Joystick buttons [Norix]

8-way input fix for some mappy.c games (grobda, motos, phozon)
These games were set to 4-way input in the previous update. [anonymous]

Various Improvements [Angelo Salese]
	vamphalf.c
	improvements to vamphalf making it almost playable* it actually
	is now playable thanks to further improvements from others (see
	below)

	yumefuda.c
	temporarly patched eeprom check,fixed the graphics bankswitching
	& added sound in Yumefuda.I don't have added controls yet so it
	isn't playable.
	
	acommand.c
	Preliminary driver for Alien Command.Doesn't work yet...

	gstriker.c
	Very preliminary MCU emulation for World Cup '94.Hangs in

Implements the LEDs in "copsnrob" [Stefan Jokisch]

Fixed res_net.h related crash in Strike Bowling [Jarek Burczynski]

Improvements to Paint and Puzzle, game is almost playable [Nicola Salmoria]

Taito F3 Improvements [Bryan McPhail]
	Recalhorn now up to a playable standard.  This game exposed some bugs in the
	way the sprite renderer handled the special command bits (ie, the sprite
	list jump command occurs _after_ the current sprite has been processed, not
	before, plus bankswitch & global positioning flags can be set on the same
	sprite - they aren't exclusive, all makes perfect sense from a hardware
	point of view).  These fixes really should be put into taito_f2 and hybrid
	f3 games as well, though I doubt it will make any visual difference.
	
	Command War is playable too, except for the fact a layer doesn't seem to
	disappear when in the fighting sequence, and it's offset by 8 pixels in the
	movement sequence.

Rohga driver Improvements [Bryan McPhail]
	Rohga - Despite massive amounts of time spent on writing trojan's to probe
	the protection this still isn't complete.  The game hangs at the end of
	level 5.  A quick look at decoprot.c should reveal just how nasty this game
	is...  Graphics emulation is complete but the priority register never seems
	to be written properly (protection?) so some things look wrong.
	
	Schmeiser Robo - Not working 100%.  The game puts graphics info through the
	protection chip so in this case the game looks wrong even though the
	gameplay is actually running correctly.  Uses a strange double buffer
	feature of the protection chip that the Deco games don't (seem to) use.

Truco Clemente driver [Ernesto Corvi]
	This is as good I could get it working...
	Problems:
	- Wrong Colors
	- Audio is not 100% yet, I think.
	
	The board is definitely a conversion of some other board. My guess is a 
	Pacman-style board, since
	some of the addresses match (watchdog, etc). Maybe somebody more 
	familiar with those type
	of boards can figure out if they used the same color proms (I tried the 
	MsPacman ones, and didn't
	match).
	
SPI background Decryption improvements [Ville Linde] 

Fixed mrtnt colours (verified to use pacman proms) [vernimark]

Hyperstone core fixes [Tomasz Slanina, Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
	Tomasz Slanina

Hyper Neogeo 64 Improvements [David Haywood]
	I won't be doing much work on this again until I buy some more RAM

	was wrong with it including the result, flags, and
	cycle count.
	- Fixed disassembly for RLA.

==========================================================================

0.86

While there are no new working games in this release it remains
interesting from a technical and development point of view mainly
due to the new PPC core as well as the Hyperstone and 37710 fixes.
It should also be a fairly stable release after the many input changes
which have taken place recently.

Driver Improvements:
--------------------

M37710, NamcoSS22 and C352 improvements [R.Belmont]
	M37710 changes (m37710.diff):
	- Data bus is actually 16 bit, not 8
	- Fixed saving of status register on interrupts
	- Fixed errors in PHB, PHT, PLT, and ANDB opcodes
	- Added XAB, PLB, and ROLB opcodes
	- Fixed IRQ dispatch errors
	- Various get_info fixes

	NamcoSS22 changes (s22.diff):
	- All CPU clocks changed to measured-by-Guru values
	- Handle the changed M37710 bus width
	- Temporarily disconnect shared RAM.  There's a
	problem where the 68020's shared RAM test wipes out
	the 37710's work variables and causes it to crash.  I
	suspect there's a register that halts or resets the
	37710.  (note: Prop Cycle has no POST and doesn't
	cause this problem, but all the other games do).

	C352 change (c352.diff):
	- Remove debug printf that accidentally snuck in

SPI Improvements [Ville Linde]
	- Improved (but not yet correct) tilemap decryption
	- Preliminary sprite priority support

PowerPC 403 core [Ville Linde, Bart Trzynadlowski, Stefano Teso]
	This is basically SuperModel (Sega Model 3 emu)'s PPC
	core minus the FPU and 6xx-series specific
	instructions (that stuff isn't ported to MAME yet). 
	As such, it's passed all manner of synthetic PPC
	torture tests and should be quite reliable for any
	PPC403-based hardware.
	
Virtua Racing improvements [Olivier Galibert, Andrew Gardner]

Hyperstone CPU Core Improvements [Tomasz Slanina, Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
	Tomasz Slanina 
	- interrputs after call and before frame are prohibited now
	- emulation of FCR register
	- Floating point opcodes (preliminary) 
	- Fixed stack addressing in RET/FRAME opcodes
	- Fixed bug in SET_RS macro
	- Fixed bug in return opcode (S flag)
	- Added C/N flags calculation in add/adc/addi/adds/addsi and some shift opcodes
	- Added writeback to ROL
	- Fixed ROL/SAR/SARD/SHR/SHRD/SHL/SHLD opcode decoding (Local/Global regs)
	- Fixed I and T flag in RET opcode
	- Fixed XX/XM opcodes
	- Fixed MOV opcode, when RD = PC
	- Fixed execute_trap() 
	- Fixed ST opcodes, when when RS = SR
	- Added interrupts
	- Fixed I/O addressing 

	Pierpaolo Prazzoli
	- Fixed fetch
	- Fixed decode of e132xs_xm opcode
	- Fixed 7 bits difference number in FRAME / RET instructions
	- Some debbugger fixes
	- Added generic registers decode function
	- Some other little fixes.

Jaleco Mahjong Driver update [Angelo Salese]
	some games are *almost* playable but still have protection issues
	
Adjusted Top Speed volume balance

Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

Misc Fixes [Nathan Woods]
	src/inptport.c:
	src/inptport.h:
	- Fixes PORT_INCLUDE by making the final IPT_END appended within 
	input_port_allocate()
	- Added some MESS specific defaults
	- Spelling fix in IPT_BILL default

Fixed some Multisession win32 bugs [Chris Kirmse]

	preliminary emulation and do nothing more than display the initial test
	screens.
Cool Riders [David Haywood]
	skeleton driver, to be continued at a later date
Pit Boss
	added to merit driver, not investigated the issues yet
Tatakae! Big Fighter [Tomasz Slanina]

Driver Improvements:
--------------------

- Turned off autocentering by default in warlords, sbrkout, and
  destroyr. There are probably others that should have this as well.
  Please post on www.mametesters.org if you have suggestions.
  [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed a number of recent errors introduced into the input port
  definitions of several drivers. [El Condor]

- Fixed various stuff with the jalmah.c driver, including suchipi
  booting, improved the video emulation a bit & attempted to add
  controls. [Angelo Salese]

- Updated Namco Super System 22 driver to use preliminary M37710
  core, but it doesn't do anything useful yet. [R. Belmont]

- Added conditional coinage to snowbros. [Inigo Luja]

- Fixed backwards controls in ckong. [Inigo Luja]


Changes to the main program:

  behavior. [Aaron Giles]

- Added a WIP Mitsu M7700 series CPU core, specifically targeting 
  the M37710. [R. Belmont]

- Removed the static MAX_DATAFILE_ENTRIES define, by retrieving the 
  game count at runtime. [Rene Single]

Driver Improvements:
--------------------

- Fixed input port definition errors in megasys1. [Mamesick]

- Fixed input port definition errors in tnzs. [Inigo Luja]

- Fixed input port definition errors in taitosj, galaxian.
  [Aaron Giles]

- Changed 720' controls to use an analog joystick instead of a

  Thanks to MAME Analog+ for the logic. [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed the colors in the Status trivia games. [Stefan Jokisch]

- Conditional DIP switches in rallyx, mcatadv, galpanic.
  [Inigo Luja]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Fixed loading of ctrlr files so that they actually take effect now.
  [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed bug preventing saving of lightgun control changes.
  [Aaron Giles]

- Changed all the analog mapping defaults back to 'keyboard' as the
  default values were confusing people. [Aaron Giles]

- Added the ability for analog axes to return "invalid" as a value
  from the OSD layer, allowing them to dynamically disable themselves.
  Using this feature, the Windows version now autodetects analog
  versus digital axes and dynamically disables the analog values if
  it thinks you are using a digital axis. Note that this even works
  if you have a "switchable" gamepad. [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed debugger crash when using F10 with the i960 core. [R. Belmont]

- Cleaned up some #ifdef MESS and united the two definitions of 
  my_stricmp. [Rene Single]

==========================================================================

0.85

Driver Improvements:
--------------------

- Fixed sprite vs. tilemap priority and sprite vs. tilemap 
  positioning for the FL games. [R. Belmont]

- Hooked up player 3 trackball in Rampart. [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed crasher in the new Mappy DIP switches. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

- Added conditional DIP switch support to Asterock. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

- Fixed Superman frame rate to match real PCB. [Robert Flory]

- Fixed sound balance in Bowlorama. [Aaron Giles]

- Added conditional coinage to a number of games. [El Condor]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Fixed bug with new command line options when using -createconfig.
  [Aaron Giles]

- Changed the way the remapping works in the ctrlr .cfg files so that
  it works more like the way the old system did. [Aaron Giles]

- Some MESS-specific additions to the new input configuration code.
  [Nathan Woods]

- Added sourcefile attribute to the -listxml output. [Logiqx]

- Fixed bug that prevented default controls that were set to "None"
  from saving/restoring properly. [Aaron Giles]

- Added feature to the general input settings so that if you hit Esc
  to cancel setting a new input sequence, it toggles between "None"
  (old behavior) and the default. This is similar to the change that
  went into u6 for the game-specific inputs. [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed load order for ctrlr files so that they don't stick in the
  default.cfg if you switch between ctrlrs. [Aaron Giles]

- Renamed the paddle/adstick/pedal/dial/trackball/lightgun default
  device selection options to paddle_device/adstick_device/
  pedal_device/dial_device/trackball_device/lightgun_device to
  prevent naming conflicts. [Aaron Giles]

- Added new port type IPT_OTHER to use for controls that don't map
  in a standard way. Modified all the Mahjong games to use this
  instead of 0 for the port type, and changed the UI to recognize
  this and show it in the game-specific inputs. [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed debugger memory access for 64-bit CPUs. [Nicola Salmoria]


==========================================================================

0.84u6

Driver Improvements:
--------------------

- Fixed Williams coin inputs. [Arthur Peale]

- Fixed Colony 7 DIP switches. [Aaron Giles]

- Hooked up 49-way joysticks in Arch Rivals and Pigskin 621AD.
  [Aaron Giles]

- Removed hacky cheat controls from Defender/Stargate. [Aaron Giles]

- Removed existing speedup cheat hack from Pacman/Ms Pac Man as 
  the way it was implemented in MAME is NOT how it was implemented 
  in the arcades. I have added the hacked software ROMs as three
  separate sets for Puck Man, Pac Man, and Ms. Pac Man. These hacked
  ROMs do not let you control the speed of the game with a button;
  the game is always fast, and Pac Man is faster than the ghosts.
  Also added a fake DIP switch to control the equivalent of the
  hardware version of the speedup hack. It can be set to "Disabled",
  "Enabled Always", or "Enabled with Button". Note that this hack
  speeds up everyone, including the ghosts, as the original hack
  did. [Aaron Giles]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Fixed several makefile errors in the last version. [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed enumeration of lightgun and joysticks in the Windows build.
  Joysticks now no longer show up unless you specify -joystick. And
  lightguns should work properly as absolute devices. [Aaron Giles]

- Added groupings to the master controls list so that the list size
  is not so unwieldy. [Aaron Giles]

- Disabled input to the game while the user interface is in active
  use (prevents keypresses from affecting the underlying game).
  [Aaron Giles]

- Added core-level support for the previously only Windows-supported
  controller files. These files now have the extension .cfg instead
  of .ini and are in the same format as the new XML-based .cfg files.
  See the ctrlr directory for some examples. [Aaron Giles]

- Made it possible to assign game-specific inputs to "None",
  effectively disabling them. To do this, select the input and hit
  enter, then cancel by hitting escape. Previously, cancelling
  would always reset you to the default key sequence for that input.
  Now, MAME alternates between the default key sequence and "None".
  [Aaron Giles]

- Added support for conditional dipswitch settings. This allows
  for multiple equivalent entries but with different text depending
  on the state of another dipswitch. See mappy.c for an example of
  how this works to handle the changing bonuses based on the number
  of lives. [Aaron Giles]

- Improved handling of interpolation for analog ports so that they
  don't wrap around and cause artifacts. [Aaron Giles]

- Added several new command line options to assist in the automatic
  enabling of analog controls:

    * -paddle (keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun)
    * -adstick (keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun)
    * -lightgun (keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun)
    * -pedal (keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun)
    * -dial (keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun)
    * -trackball (keyboard|mouse|joystick|lightgun)

  For example -dial mouse will automatically enable mouse controls
  (just like -mouse) if a dial control is present for the selected
  game. [Aaron Giles]

- Improved -verbose output display to enumerate all joysticks and
  joystick axes that have been detected. Useful for the new
  -digital command line parameter below. [Aaron Giles]

- Added a command line parameter to control which joystick axes are
  considered digital. If you are using a digital gamepad with MAME, 
  you will want to use this option. There are a number of ways to 
  do this:

    * -digital all means that all axes of all connected joysticks
      will be treated as digital.

    * -digital none means that all axes of all connected joysticks
      will be treated as analog (this is the previous behavior).
    
    * -digital j2 will treat all axes of joystick #2 as digital;
      axes on all other joysticks will be treated as analog.

    * -digital j1a0a1 will treat axis 0 and 1 on joystick #1 as
      digital; all other axes will be treated as analog.

    * -digital j1a0a1,j2a5 will treat axis 0 and 1 on joystick #1
      as digital, as well as axis 5 on joystick #2; all other axes
      will be treated as analog.

  Make use of the new -verbose information to determine which 
  joysticks and axes you should be configuring this way.

- Removed PORT_CHEAT from a number of drivers and documented the
  cheats in the port names. [El Condor]

- Added several more default strings and some MESS-specific fixes.

    * xmen.c: FM/PCM balance, Z80 clock is 8 MHz (???)

- Fixed input ports in the megasys1 driver. [Mamesick]

- Fixed naming of the various Centipede bootlegs. [Stefan Jokisch]

- Fixed incorrect graphics decode in the Donkey Kong driver.
  [Andrea Mazzoleni]

- Fixed DIP switches in the Midway Zeus games. [Brian Troha]

- Improved colors in Strike Bowling. [Jarek Burczynski]

- 4bpp/8bpp tilemaps in ST-0016 driver [Tomasz Slanina]

- Hooked up NVRAM for Namco system 12 correctly. [smf]

- Improved QSound in ZN games by fixing ROM loading. [Barry Rodewald]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Fixed subtle behavior in the ALLPOT handlers for the POKEY when held
  in reset. [MikeJ]

- Added generic support for save states on games using the generic bitmap
  video hardware. Also converted a number of drivers over to using that
  system. [Andrew Gardner]

- Fixed memory crash in the TMS34010 core. [Andrea Mazzoleni]

- Fixed the mixer code so it doesn't crash if the OSD layer returns an
  error. [Andrea Mazzoleni]

- Fixed an issue in the H8/3002 core where the timer start register would
  mess up timers that were already running.  Improves the music tempo for
  S12 games.

- Added new function: compute_resistor_net_outputs() in res_net.h. This 
  function calculates outputs (not weights) of color circuits where the
  hardware consists of open collector PROMs. [Jarek Burczynski]

- Preliminary NEC V810 core (needed for mayjinsen, mayjinsen2 and jsk).
  [Thomasz Slanina]

- Fixed several compilation issues for LinuxPPC and other ports.
  [Lawrence Gold]

- Fixed disassembly in mirrored regions for the 6502. [Curt Coder]

- Improved i386 disassembly format. [Ville Linde]

- Removed PORT_CENTER from drivers that were using it for autocentering
  and added a user-configurable autocentering property that applies to
  all absolute analog controls. Also made this autocentering intelligent
  so that it shouldn't need to be manually set to 0 if using a real
  analog device. [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed mame_fprintf to output various text file formats based on the
  compile-time define CRLF. This must be set and can be equal to 1 (CR
  only), 2 (LF only) or 3 (CR+LF). [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed several bugs in the new input system and improved the CFG file
  format. [Aaron Giles]

0.84u4

WARNING: There have been some major internal changes as of this build.
Furthermore, the controller.ini support is temporarily disabled. Any 
other input-related bugs, please report to www.mametesters.org.

WARNING: Because of the extension to 32-bits, all existing INP files
are invalid. MAME now writes 4 bytes per INP entry instead of 2.


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Added a number of commented-out default strings and modified all drivers
  to use them. [Aaron Giles]

- Changed the format of .cfg files to use XML. All old .cfg files are useless,
  just toss them away. This should allow for easier backwards compatibility
  in the future. [Aaron Giles]

- MAME now requires the expat library for XML support. This is included in the
  distribution, and is built automatically by default. You can comment out
  BUILD_EXPAT in the main makefile to disable this behavior and link against
  a precompiled version if you wish. Similarly, zlib has been modified to do
  the same thing and is now included with the MAME source. Comment out the
  BUILD_ZLIB flag to turn off this behavior and link against a precompiled
  lib. [Aaron Giles]

- Revamped most of the input and input port system. This means a number of
  changes for those who do their own OSD layer. All input APIs are now
  unified -- there is no notion of "keyboard" versus "joystick" anymore. The
  following APIs are now obsolete:

    osd_get_key_list
    osd_is_key_pressed
    osd_get_joy_list
    osd_is_joy_pressed
    osd_is_joystick_axis_code
    osd_lightgun_read
    osd_trak_read
    osd_analogjoy_read
    osd_customize_inputport_defaults

  Instead there is a new set of simpler APIs:

    osd_get_code_list
    osd_get_code_value
    osd_customize_inputport_list

  The code list returned by osd_get_code_list should include entries for every
  keyboard key, every joystick and mouse button, digital versions of joystick
  analog axes (e.g., joystick X axis up), as well as entries for analog axes on
  joysticks, mice, lightguns, etc. Essentially any input you wish to expose to
  the user should be added to this list. Note that if you add items to this
  list that don't map to the standard defaults, you must specify one of:
  CODE_OTHER_DIGITAL, CODE_OTHER_ANALOG_ABSOLUTE, or CODE_OTHER_ANALOG_RELATIVE
  to indicate what type of input you are providing.

  osd_get_code_value is then later called to retrieve the value for a given
  code. Digital inputs should return either 0 or 1. Absolute analog inputs
  should return values between ANALOG_VALUE_MIN (-65536) and ANALOG_VALUE_MAX
  (65536). Relative analog inputs should return values that approximately
  scale to 512 units per pixel (e.g., an X axis moving left 4 pixels should
  return -4*512 = -2048).

  Finally, osd_customize_inputport_list replaces osd_customize_inputport_defaults
  and allows you to add any OSD-specific UI input ports, as well as mess with
  the default configuration. Note that at this time, the controller.ini file
  support is currently disabled in the Windows build. [Aaron Giles]

- The configuration of ports has changed a bit now as well. You can now map
  any analog axis to an analog port in the standard input UI. There are now
  three entries per analog port. The first entry is the analog mapping. The
  second and third control the digital decrementing and incrementing
  sequences. To map an analog axis, just hit ENTER and then move the axis
  in question by a large amount. [Aaron Giles]

- Added 32-bit port read handlers, and extended input port internals to 32 bits.
  [Aaron Giles]


==========================================================================

0.84u3

Driver Improvements:
--------------------

- Fixed graphics crashing, palette, sprites, and some networking 
  registers in Final Lap. [R. Belmont]

- Several Seibu SPI fixes. [Ville Linde]
    * Removed all remaining sound hacks
    * Added some missing i386 opcodes
    * Added support for external read/write handlers to
      the YMF271  (required for SPI flash ROM updating mode).
    * Hooked up flash ROMs via the new YMF271 support. 
    * Fixed various crash bugs in rf2_us, rf2_2k, and
      rf2_eur.

- Added a DMA kludge to get Derby Quiz My Dream Horse to boot. [R. Belmont]

- Major rewrite of the Portraits driver. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
   - fixed scrolling
   - fixed screen resolution
   - added NVRAM
   - added fake photo when you get the best score
   - fixed service switches and coins
   - added missing roms and the 2nd set

- Fixed save states in the m62 and mnight drivers. [Andrew Gardner]

- Fixed the PSX SIO timer so that it only fires when there is data to 
  send & processes one bit per tick. [smf]

- Cleaned up and reorganized the DCS sound module. This required changing
  the way ROMs are loaded for all of the DCS-using games. [Aaron Giles]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Fixed crash in the MIPS core introduced with the u2 changes. [Aaron Giles]

- Changed the "driver.status" entry in -listxml to summarize all the status 
  entries allowing frontends to completely ignore all the other flags.
  [Andrea Mazzoleni]

- Fixed the generic_fopen() function to ensure that a rom CRC is present 
  before using it. Otherwise, for NO_DUMP roms an uninitialized
  string variable is used in the search. [Andrea Mazzoleni]

- Added the ability to tweak the refresh rate if -cheat is enabled.
  Use SHIFT to modify by 0.1fps, CONTROL to modify by 0.01fps, and
  ALT to modify by 0.001fps. [Aaron Giles]

0.84u2

Driver Improvements:
--------------------

- Fixed ROM naming for Crazy Climber bootleg. [Brian Troha]

- Fixed background scrolling in Mustang. [David Haywood]

- Cleaned up PORT_CHEAT and tagged ports for a number of drivers. [El Condor]

- Added save state support to the Namco System 1 driver. [Andrew Gardner]

- Improvements to the Namco System 12 driver. [R. Belmont]
    - MCU is now emulated rather than HLE'd.
    - MCU peripherals mostly figured out and hooked up.
    - Preliminary sound and music are now present.
    - Inputs and coinage are now handled by the MCU, so
      all bugs related to them are hopefully fixed.
    - Fixed bug with save states.
    - sws99 and pacapp both seem playable now (not sure if
      due to these changes or smf's core work) so took off
      GAME_NOT_WORKING for them.
    - Added support for alternate ROM banking protection
      used by golgo13, so it runs now (there's a very long
      black screen at the beginning, just wait it out).  The
      gun inputs are partially supported but not working yet
      because I'm unable to figure out what format the game
      wants the data in.


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- More i960 bugfixes. [R. Belmont]
    * Fixed a brown-paper-bag bug where the PC and AC
      registers were getting swapped on return from
      interrupts.
    * Rewrote the frame cache mechanism using a simple
      FIFO concept.  Final Lap R now runs further.
    * Aligned reads and writes now use the full-size paths
      through the core instead of always breaking everything
      down into bytes.

- Added a core for the Hitachi H8/3002 MCU. [R. Belmont]
  It was originally written by the Zinc authors for Zinc.  I've
  fairly extensively rewritten it and adapted it to MAME
  semantics with their permission.  Cycle counts are
  probably not right because the manual's a bit
  confusing, but they're at least ballpark.

- Added a preliminary core for the Namco C352 PCM chip. [R. Belmont]
  It was originally written by the Zinc authors
  for Zinc and has been adapted for MAME by me with
  their permission.  It's not sounding real great yet on
  music, although it's better than the Zinc original.

- Added support for non-integral clock multipliers in the MIPS3
  core. [Aaron Giles]

- Refactored the Voodoo code, fixing several errors in the LOD
  calculations and the Voodoo 2 command FIFO. [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed bug that prevented changes to the default controls from
  sticking. [Aaron Giles]

Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- A number of obsolete backward compatibility macros have been removed. [Aaron Giles]
  See this list for the equivalents if you have a driver that is using them:

     cpu_set_reset_line -> cpunum_set_input_line
     cpu_set_halt_line -> cpunum_set_input_line
     cpu_set_irq_line -> cpunum_set_input_line
     cpu_set_irq_line_and_vector -> cpunum_set_input_line_and_vector

     timer_suspendcpu -> cpunum_suspend/cpunum_resume
     timer_holdcpu -> cpunum_suspend/cpunum_resume
     cpu_getstatus -> cpunum_is_suspended
     timer_get_overclock -> cpunum_get_clockscale
     timer_set_overclock -> cpunum_set_clockscale

     cpu_gettotalcycles -> cpunum_gettotalcycles
     cpu_gettotalcycles64 -> cpunum_gettotalcycles64

     keyboard_name -> code_name
     keyboard_pressed -> code_pressed
     keyboard_pressed_memory -> code_pressed_memory
     keyboard_pressed_memory_repeat -> code_pressed_memory_repeat
     keyboard_read_async -> code_read_async

     install_mem_read*_handler -> memory_install_read*_handler
     install_mem_write*_handler -> memory_install_write*_handler
     install_port_read*_handler -> memory_install_read*_handler
     install_port_write*_handler -> memory_install_write*_handler
     memory_install_read*_handler_mirror -> memory_install_read*_handler
     memory_install_write*_handler_mirror -> memory_install_write*_handler

     READ_HANDLER -> READ8_HANDLER
     WRITE_HANDLER -> WRITE8_HANDLER

- Miscellaneous cleanups and refactorings done primarily to support 
  a new MESS specific feature.  Also removed some '#if 0' code. [Nathan Woods]

- New input port definitions, similar to the new memory map definitions. You can
  continue to use the old PORT_BIT, PORT_BITX, and PORT_ANALOG macros for now, but
  it is preferred going forward that all ports use only PORT_BIT, and append all
  other flags and options using the new macros. See pacman.c for an example of the
  new format. The new input ports also support tagging for easier tracking of ports,
  and the ability to import port definitions from another set. [Nathan Woods]

- Two minor fixes to xml2info so that 'mame -listxml|xml2info' matches 
  'mame -listinfo' exactly. [Logiqx]

- New option in the Windows version: -wavwrite to save sound output to a WAV file. [smf]

- Removed -listinfo option now that xml2info produces fully correct output. [Aaron Giles]

- Added ADSP2181 variant to the ADSP21xx CPU cores. [Aaron Giles]

- Added support for many more instruction forms in x86drc.h. [Aaron Giles]

- Added consistency checking for the year field. [Nathan Woods]

- Removed some silly 6502 speedups in the Atari games. [Aaron Giles]

Nintendo 8080 hardware update [Stefan Jokisch]

The driver has now been split into three parts. A few features that have been missing
in Helifire since my last update are back, i.e. the flickering colors when you're shot
and the volume decay effect (this affects the melody at the start of a game and a few
tunes that can be heard during the bonus scenes every twelve attack waves). The
starfield should now scroll at the correct speed, it's only 75% of what it used to be.
Finally, I have decided to use the color prom from Space Fever in Space Launcher, I
think it's correct.

386 updates [Nathan Woods]
	-  Added a distinction between maskable and non maskable interrupts 
	(like int 3, illegal instruction etc)
	-  Added a distinction between invalid and unimplemented instructions.

	call osd_die() for now
	-  i386_set_irq_line() will no longer raise an interrupt when passed 
	with state=0
	-  Various string intructions now use SI/DI instead of ESI/EDI when in

	bugfix for lst and lst1 opcodes; the "ignore ARP" hack has been replaced with a better hack, that doesn't interfere with indirect addressing.

	Preliminary serial I/O support has been added, to update DRR/DXR on RINT and XINT interrupts.  set_irq_line() no longer masks the lines with 0x7; this allows external triggering of RINT/XINT interrupts.

	System22 driver changes:

	- display list processing is now done by the master DSP
	- the slave DSP's in-game graphics processing and "custom render devices" are currently simulated, which works only for Prop Cycle
	- support for PDP block-based memory transfers
	- support for DSP data/code uploads from main CPU
	- support for "Point RAM" and "Point ROM" access
	- most self tests are working in Prop Cycle and Ridge Racer (Japan)
	- prelim hand-crafted "internal ROMs" for master and slave DSP
	- various notes regarding DSP ports/addressing

	Fixes kinst067red.

	Instructions of the form:
	ld   r10,0(r10)
	Would load the low word into r10 first, and then use the modified r10 (plus
	4) as the address of the high word. Bad bad bad.
	Fixes the sky graphics in several of the kinst2 levels. 

ZN Improvements [smf]
	24-bit rendering support for Judge Dredd

Updates to the 'jalmah' driver [Angelo Salese]
	kakumei and kakumei2 now boot but neither are playable due to protection

Misc Updates [Nathan Woods]
	src/windows/windows.mak:
	- Fixes the afore mentioned problem with x86drc.c

	src/fileio.c:
	src/windows/fileio.c:
	- Adds in a new (windows only) mode for opening files whereby files 
	  can be opened for read/write, but changes are not actually not written 
	  to the original file but rather to a temporary file.  This trick is used 
	  by the MESS testing facility so that tests do not mutate the images they 
	  operate on.
	- Small cleanups

	src/png.c:
	- Replaces a #ifdef MESS/#else/#endif combo with a usage of the 
	  APPNAME macro

SPI / 386 updates [Ville Linde]
	* raidnfgt now runs normally and correctly through
	  attract mode and gameplay, modulo the encrypted
	  graphics.  Still kinda mesmerizing :-)
	* viperp1 starts to boot now, but doesn't get very far
	* Hooked up the Z80 bankswitching, so sound started
	  playing in some games (notably Raiden Fighters). (R.Belmont)

Various ST-V updates [Mariusz Wojcieszek]
	fixes sprites in groovef which is now playable, adds some RBG0 scrolling
	which greatly improves background graphics in cotton2, cottonbm, grdforce
	and othellos

Debugger Fixes [Aaron Giles]
	This is a quick attempt to make the debugger more useable with the new
	memory system. The masking of addresses and data should now be working
	properly again.

	Also, you can go to any memory window and type 'P' to view program address
	space, or 'T' to view data address space.

OSD 'NO EXECUTE' Support [Aaron Giles]
	This patch introduces two new OSD functions:

	osd_alloc_executable();
	osd_free_executable();

	For most platforms, these can just map to malloc and free. However, starting
	with WinXP SP2, if you are running on a processor that supports the
	NO_EXECUTE bit (currently only 64-bit AMD chips),
	standard user-mode memory allocations won't allow you to put code in them
	and execute it.

	Since this is exactly what x86drc.c does, I've added the two functions
	above. On Windows, these map to calling VirtualAlloc and VirtualFree, which
	allow you to specify the read/write/execute states of the pages thus
	allocated.

Lethal Justice / Egg Venture Cleanups [Aaron Giles]
	* merged memory maps
	* fixed video size in Egg Venture to correct flicker
	* switched to VIDEO_RGB_DIRECT
	* removed unnecessary ROM regions and memcpy'ing

Rockola Cleanups / Fixes [Curt Coder]
	* Fantasy/Nibbler/Pioneer Balloon
	drivers/rockola.c
	sndhrdw/rockola.c
	- Correct CPU frequency from schematics
	- Hooked up SN76477 sound for BOMB effect
	- Merged memory maps
	- Cleaned up driver a bit
	- Fixed dips
	- Enabled debug inputs

	these changes could do with being verified on a real 68k

	m68kcpu.h, m68kcpu.c:
	---------------------
	A) scc (68000 only): CYC_SCC_R_FALSE was defined, not used, and misnamed as
	   the extra 2 cycles happens when CC is true: now used and renamed to
	   CYC_SCC_R_TRUE

	m68kmake.c:
	-----------
	B) add/adda/and/or/sub/suba (68000 only): the 'extra 2 cycles' cases were not
	   handled correctly: corrected to be effective on .l only, and also on register
	   direct (previously, all sizes were affected, and only in immediate mode)

	C) jmp d(An,Xn) / pea (An) (68000/68010): tables corrected

	D) movem (68000/68010): generated basecount were incorrect in many cases, so I
	   added a dedicated table

	m68k_in.c:
	----------

	E) movem.l d(PC),reglist / movem.l d(PC,Xn),reglist (68000/68010): changed
	   basecount

	F) asr/asl/lsr/lsl/ror/rol/roxr/roxl (68000/68010): added '+2n' cycles where
	   missing, as the shift/rotate memory is the only case where '+2n' does not
	   apply, and is treated in a specific opcode handler.

General Source Changes

CHDCD / Konami GV update [R.Belmont]
- Preliminary CD-ROM support for CHDMAN.  Input is from CDRDAO
  .toc/.bin  images (cdrdao.sourceforge.net). CDRDAO comes with utilities
  to convert CDRWIN .cue/.bin images to .toc/.bin format.
- Intel Flash ROM emulation support
- CDROM emulation primitives, including Red Book audio playback
- CDROM support for the AM53cf96 SCSI controller
- Konami GV System driver.  GV System is identical to a home
  Playstation/PSOne console, except the CD-ROM is SCSI instead of 
  proprietary.

Stuff still in progress:
- The SPU emulation needs a lot of help, especially on Wedding Rhapsody. 
  smf is working on it.
- The SCSI CD-ROM emulation needs to be separated out from the AM53cf96 if
  we ever emulate other SCSI controllers or CD-ROM drives.
- CHDMAN doesn't output anything useful when you extract a CHD-CD.  It
  should write out a CDRDAO image.
- Audio tracks on CDs are not compressed at present (or more accurately
  they're gzip compressed, which is useless).  The plan is to use FLAC at
  some point.

Misc Fixes [Nathan Woods]
	src/mame.c:
	src/mame.h:
	src/windows/config.c:
	   - Changed options.savegame to be a string.  If this is a one 
	character string, then the save state is loaded as before.  If it is a 
	larger string, then cpu_loadsave_schedule_file() is used.

	src/state.c:
	src/state.h:

	validate a state save file

Some Task Force Harrier Improvements [Tomasz Slanina]

- fixed sprite rendering
- hacks for bg scrolling
- patched some protection issues (sprites are rendered,
  no more strange resets)
Game is NOT playable (controls doesn't work).
Maybe something is not mapped correctly or
it's problem with protection (for example ,

ST-V fixes [Mariusz Wojcieszek]
	- improved scaling tilemap backgrounds. Vfkids, colmns97 and vfremix backgrounds
	  are better now.
	- fixed a problem where entering and existing service mode during game causes master
	 / slave communication to fail. It turned out that slave cpu should be reset when it
	 is turned off and on. This helps all games in driver.

- pacland: fixed tilemap scroll offsets and sprite positions
- pacland: accurate emulation of tile/sprite priority (including fix of bugs introduced when
  the driver was converted to tilemaps) and sprite visibility area
- pacland36b16 is not a bug - colors match the real game
- added SOUND_NAMCO_CUS30 for better documentation (alias for the standard SOUND_NAMCO)
- drgnbstr36rc2gre
- skykidd works with a patch (a dump of the CUS60A internal ROM is needed to do without the
  patch)
- metrocross: fixed irq enable, this fixes inputs in service mode
- baraduke060gre
- baraduke36rc2gre, it is improved, there are still gaps left but this is correct behaviour
  verified on the real board
- baraduke, system86: understood how sprite RAM buffering works, this fixes sprite lag but
  causes a glitch in rthunder (which might be correct behaviour)
- system86: totally rewritten the 63701X emulation and moved it to a separate module.  Fixed 
  silence compression, this improves quality in some samples; supported volume control.
  -genpeitd067gre
- rthundro37b14red I think is fixed; but the game still sometimes crashes when you die
- rthunder, genpetid: fixed watchdog emulation, this allows entering service mode without
  resetting

Game Driver Changes
===================
* poolshrk - Converted to new component value only code.
* firetrk, montecar, superbug - Converted to new component value only code.
Pulled discrete code out and put in sndhrdw\ataridis.c.  montecar still needs
filtering on crash sound.
* atarifb, canyon & skydiver - minor changes to work with new code.
* triplhnt - added component value discrete sound, but have not figured out
Shot and Bear Roar video memory locations.  These are needed to make sound

Timer System Update [Aaron Giles]

The timer system is now integer-based instead of floating-point based. It requires
64-bit ints. I've defined a new type 'mame_time' which is a 96-bit time value.
There are 32 bits for counting full seconds, and 64 bits for counting subseconds.
This type is used extensively in the core timer system and the CPU scheduler.

The accuracy of the new system is down to 1 attosecond (10^-18 seconds).
This may seem excessive, but for a 100MHz CPU, each clock cycle is 10^10
attoseconds. That works nicely because 100MHz divides evenly. For a 96MHz
CPU, each clock cycle is 1.041666667 * 10^10 attoseconds. Rounding, we lose
1/3 of an attosecond per cycle in error. Multiply that error by 96000000 and
you end up with an error of 32000000 attoseconds. Fortunately, that's only
0.032ns, but if I had much less accuracy than this, the errors would start
to add up in a more significant way.

All the existing APIs are still around, and doubles can still be passed as
arguments. But they are all immediately connverted to 'mame_time' values for
processing.

The old system had some drifting errors due to FP rounding which are gone
now.

Big 80s Namco Update [Nicola Salmoria]

this affects the first Namco games that used custom I/O chips.
- these files are no longer needed and should be removed: drivers/bosco.c,
  drivers/xevious.c, drivers/digdug.c, machine/digdug.c, machine/galaga.c,
  machine/bosco.c, machine/polepos.c, sndhrdw/bosco.c
- added three new sound chips: NAMCO_15XX, NAMCO_52XX, NAMCO_54XX, and
  changed drivers to use them (NAMCO_54XX is just a placeholder playing
  samples, until the chip is reverse engineered).
- added EAROM support to digdug
- fixed the polepos2 title screen which had been broken since day 1, strange
  that nobody noticed.
- fixed various mistakes in the polepos ROM loading (one missing speech ROM
  in polepos,  polepos2 was using the wrong engine sound ROMs (it's turbo!),
  added missing vertical scaling PROMs).
- extensive documentation of ROM names and placement, and differences
  between Namco and licensed versions.
- converted all drivers to tilemaps, and made gfx emulation more accurate
  according to schematics
- polepos sprite zooming should now be closer to the hardware.
- IP_KEY_PREVIOUS and IP_JOY_PREVIOUS are no longer used by any driver: they
  may be removed from the core.
- support for start lamps, coin counters and coin lockout (all
  internallyhandled by the custom I/O chip)
- toggling the test switch while the game is running enters test mode
  without need to manually reset.
- found and documented test mode Easter eggs in all games except Xevious.
- bosconian now uses a different sound PROM, which seems more correct.
- galaga uses better dumps of the PROMs, with the unused top 4 bits set to
  0.
- correct handling of 52XX sample start/end pointers in ROM.
- better emulation of 50XX custom, no more need for hacks in bosconian.
- swapped digdug and digdugb, the main set should be the newer one.
- removed these galaga clones: nebulbee (copyright/name change), galagab2
  (mix 'n match of ROMs from other sets), galaga84 (copyright/gfx change),
  galagads (1-byte hack to get fast shoot,
  reproducible with this line in cheat.dat:
  galaga:1:070D:0D:100:Fast Shoot)
- added Galaga rev. B, which is now the main set, renamed the other galagao.
- added galagamk, a different Midway version.
- removed various bad dumps from polepos2b and poleps2c, they turned out to
  be the same version so poleps2c is removed.
- drivers/locomotn.c is no longer needed and should be removed
- converted to tilemaps, consolidated as much as I could
- fixed: jungler37b3gre
- correct tile/sprite priority handling (also in Bosconian)
- documented the Easter egg in Rally X
- added starfield in Tactician
- fixed the RC filter control in the games with Konami sound

Big Namco NB1 update [Phil Stroffolino]
Various improvements for System NB emulation, including:
- new driver: Greatest Slugger '93 (Japan)
- hardware shadow support (used heavily in Greatest Slugger)
- dedicated random number generator chip
- sprite stretch glitch (affects Outfoxies intro)
- tilemap tile banking feature (used by Mach Breakers)
- removed several game-specific hacks; now uses dedicated CPU registers
  for interrupts
- preliminary support for screen blanking (hides garbage in Outfoxies)
- proper POSIRQ handling, for scanline effects.  Fixes the water
  effects in Outfoxies.  This same feature needs to be folded into System
  2 emulation, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.
- various Mach Breaker-specific hacks for interpretting the ROZ layer
  registers; these aren't yet fully understood.  In particular, the
  "Monster Pull" stage is missing a "3d floor."

General Source Changes

Another big memory change. [Aaron Giles]

The biggest change is the way address maps are declared in the drivers. Rather than having 
separate read and write address maps, there is now support for a single, merged map. In order to 
minimize the amount of code churn, there is currently still support for two separate address 
maps per address space, but they are combined into one internally early on in the memory 
initialization and setup.

Because of this change, the 'start' macro for address maps has changed. The old set of macros:

   PROGRAM_READ*_MAP_START(name)
   DATA_READ*_MAP_START(name)
   IO_READ*_MAP_START(name)

has been replaced by a single macro:

   ADDRESS_MAP_START(name, address_space, bits)

and all drivers have been updated to use this new mechanism. In addition, all the PROGRAM_*, DATA_*,
and IO_* synonyms are now merged into a single ADDRESS_* macro. For example, PROGRAM_MAP_FLAGS is
now just ADDRESS_MAP_FLAGS.

The next big change is that the address maps, in addition to being unified, are no longer static
arrays. Rather, they are constructed in much the same way the machine drivers are constructed.
Through a series of macros, the address maps are built up in code and type-checked along the way.
All existing MAME drivers have been updated to the new macros.

In addition, there are many new options available to support extra features like mirroring, 
automatic pointer assignment, and shared memory pointers. As of this version, only seattle.c and
system24.c have been updated to support the new constructs. Use these as examples of what can be
done. Also, see the top of memory.c for an explanation of all the new macros.

Once again, the way memory is automatically allocated has changed. It is now done based on the
memory maps, like it used to be, but with the added support for shared pointers and hard-coded
pointers into memory regions.

Save states should now work, but once again, they are saving more data than is strictly
necessary.

Internally, the way address map lookup tables has changed, so that subtables can be reused. This
is important if a small memory region is mirrored across a large address space; the old code
didn't coalesce identical subtables, which would have blown up in a big way with tricky mirrors.

Renamed a bunch of internal memory state, including OP_ROM, OP_RAM, and several others.

Added save state support for 64-bit data types. [Olivier Galibert]

Discrete Sound SYstem Updates [Derrick Renaud]

	Discrete Sound Changes
	======================
	* fixed/added more documentation of functions at top of discrete.h
	* DISCRETE_RCFILTER - fixed bug that allowed module to use nodes not available to it.
	  Can't beleive it did not crash before.

	New Discrete Modules Added
	==========================
	* DISCRETE_CRFILTER - high pass R/C filter.
	* DISCRETE_COUNTER - Presettable up/down counter, external clock with selectable count edge.
	* DISCRETE_COUNTER_FIX - Presettable up/down counter with bult-in frequency generator.
	* DISCRETE_ONESHOT - Fixed it. Added selectable: edge trigger; re-trigger; output active state.
	* DISCRETE_ONESHOTR - Same as DISCRETE_ONESHOT but with reset.

	Game Driver Changes
	===================
	* poolshrk - Discrete sound emulation added.
	* bsktball - changed bounce sound to use DISCRETE_CRFILTER.

Updates to the Gameplan driver [Nicola Salmoria]
	- rewritten using machine/6522via.c and machine/6532riot.c, which weren't
	  available at the time it was created. This fixed the gfx problems and bad
	  sound.
	- vidhrdw/gameplan.c is no longer needed.
	- machine/6532riot: added PA7 adge detect and irq callback
	- machine/6522via: fixed port writes so that pins set as input are pulled
	  high. This is required by the gameplan games and is confirmed by the 65422
	  data sheet. Added support for CA2 pulse handshake.

System 21 updates [Phil Stroffolino]
	- hooked up preliminary support for System21's "depth bias" feature,
	  used as a corrective factor when sorting polygons by representative z
	  value.  It's not perfect, but a step in the right direction.
	- improved polygon colors in CyberSled
	- better parsing of CyberSled's display list; title screen and ingame
	  graphics now appear and are mostly correct
	- hooked up CyberSled input ports; they can be configured with the
	  usual mechanism: hold the 'service' key while flipping the test
	  dipswitch
	- added near-plane clipping for System21's flat-shaded polygons
	- hooked up the view transform, used in Starblade to tilt the screen
	  when player is targeting the edges of the playfield
	- hooked up a private (placeholder) implementation of zdrawgfx() for
	  C355 sprite rendering, adding sprite-tilemap orthogonality for all
	  games using that chip.
	- C355 sprite rendering no longer relies on game-specific hacks for XY
	  placement or cropping
	- some rudimentary work has been done for "Winning Run '91"; this game
	  runs on prototype System21 hardware, and as such is quite different
	  from the other titles.  It uses a 3rd 68k CPU to render graphics to a
	  bitmap layer (there is no sprite chip), but still appears to rely on
	  DSPs for 3d graphics.
	- updated System21 notes/comments.

Fixed the following bugs created / revealed by Aaron's updates
	VSNes dual games not working [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
	warning messages on decocass.c, tnzs.c, cvs.c
	raiga sound
	gsword bad ram message

	Indoor Soccer [Brian A. Troha]
	Radical Radial [Stefan Jokisch]

SUpport USB Keyboard LEDs [smf]
	-led_mode ps/2 is the default and uses DeviceIOControl
	-led_mode usb uses keybd_event()

	This only affects windows nt/2000/xp.

	There might be a way of using DeviceIOControl to change the led's on usb
	keyboards, but I can't find it.
	Using keybd_event() may have problems restoring on exit, but at least it
	does work.

Save state loading from command line [smf]
	Adds -state to the windows version. The code was already in the core to
	handle it, all this patch does is allows you to set options.savegame
	Not sure how reliable it is, it worked for galaxian.

Phase 2 of Aaron's Updates [Aaron Giles]
----------------------------------------

Changes:
* CPUs with an implicit address shift (e.g., the TMS34010 shifts addresses
right 3 bits; the TMS32031 shifts addresses left 2 bits) now automatically
get that shift applied to addresses in their memory maps and in calls to
install_memory_read/write_handler(). This eliminates many ugly macros in the
memory maps. Affected CPU cores are the ADSP210x, CCPU, PIC16C5x, TMS3201x,
TMS3202x, TMS32031, and TMS340x0. Note that the CPU cores themselves still
need to pass shifted values to the core read/write routines. All drivers
using these cores have had their icky macros and bitshifts removed.

* Harvard architecture CPUs now have data memory fully implemented now.
Affected CPUs are the ADSP210x, TMS3201x, TMS3202x, PIC16C5x, and CCPU. All
cores have been modified to fully split program and data memory. All drivers
using these cores now specify explicit program and data memory maps. This
also gets rid of a ton of ugly macros used in memory maps.

* The memory_set_bankhandler calls are now officially history. There were
fewer than a dozen drivers using them, and they all have been converted over
to using install_mem_read_handler instead where appropriate. This eliminates
the last 8-bit-specific hack in the memory system. As a result, RAM reads
and writes out of banked memory should be slightly faster on 8-bit CPUs
because they are handled inline.

* New dynamic memory allocation scheme. The previous method relied on
parsing the read/write handlers. The new method simply looks at the
top-level memory map after it has been populated, and allocates memory for
any mapped 16k chunk. This will likely cause more memory to be allocated
than before, but the process is less error prone. Also, checks are now in to
make sure that the memory_region for the program address space is the
minimum necessary to support non-sparse address spaces.

* Fully integrated save/restore memory blocks. Before, the save/restore
system had its own memory map walking routines. That's gone now. Instead,
memory blocks are registered as they are allocated by the dynamic memory
allocator. Note that this will likely cause save states to be bigger than
they were before (and certainly, they will not be compatible), but disk
space is cheap, live with it.

* Address spaces are now determined dynamically based on whether a given CPU
returns a non-zero value for the address bus width for a given space.

* Fixed incorrect address bus widths on the I8039 CPU core.

* Added a TMS32026 entry and reworked the handling of internal RAM to work
in the new system. This means the Taito Air system is now back to its former
state.

* Fixed the memory handlers in gottlieb.c to use address space masking
instead of mapping extra mirrored areas.

Some ST-V alpha blending [Mariusz Wojcieszek]
	see bakubaku playfield, mausuke playfield, shienryu clouds etc.

Huge Namco Mappy Era Systems Update [Nicola Salmoria]

- Most games merged into mappy.c, so the following files are no longer
needed:
drivers/superpac.c vidhrdw/superpac.c machine/superpac.c
drivers/grobda.c vidhrdw/grobda.c machine/grobda.c
drivers/phozon.c vidhrdw/phozon.c machine/phozon.c
machine/mappy.c
- one new file: machine/namcoio.c. This implements the 56XX and 58XX I/O
custom chips used by all the games. The I/O chips are now accurately
simulated, fixing subtle nuances during normal operation and not-so-subtle
ones in test mode; e.g. you can now scroll the grid in Mappy's test mode.
- fixed and verified inputs and dip switches for all games.
- found and documented the Easter eggs in all games except Toy Pop.
- fixed interrupt and sub cpu reset handling, which caused some games to
report errors when entering test mode without resetting.
- added detailed memory maps where schematics allowed.
- all drivers converted to tilemaps
- cocktail mode in Phozon, and non-hack implementation in Gaplus
- fixed priorities in superpac. With the previos code, ghost eyes had
priority over everything else, even other sprites, giving wrong results when
two ghosts overlapped.
- round advance dip switch in Gaplus available & working
- fixed a missing sound effect in Phozon that nobody would have ever
noticed.
- I've also included a revised warpwarp.c, converted to tilemaps and with
the Warp Warp Easter egg documented.

The only change in u2 is the overhaul of the memory system mentioned below, no new drivers have been
added
 
General Source Changes
----------------------
 
Significant overhaul of the memory system. This is the first of several phases, but it lays the 
groundwork for future improvements. This first change will also be the most disruptive, touching every
CPU core and every driver file [Aaron Giles]

Memory system changes
---------------------

The biggest change is the introduction of the concept of address spaces. Each CPU can have up to 3 
separate address spaces now, with the possibility of easily adding more in the future. Each address 
space has its own addressing semantics, including databus width, address bus width, address shift, and 
unmapped memory value.

The three existing address spaces are defined to be program, data, and I/O. The program address space is 
where code is assumed to live; it is also where all memory lives in standard von Neumann architecture 
CPUs. The data address space is for Harvard architecture CPUs, and will be used in the future to do 
proper program/data separation for the CCPU, PIC16C5x, ADSP210x, TMS32010, and TMS32025. The I/O address 
space is used for port accesses, such as those performed by the Z80 and x86 CPUs.

The read/write handlers used by CPUs to access memory have all been renamed in the shuffle, both in order
to match the address space naming conventions (program/data/io) and in order to make it clearer what they
do. In addition, they have been unified to a large degree. Instead of separate memory accessors based on 
both the address bus width and the data bus width, there is now just one shared set of memory accessors 
for each data bus width. Here are some examples of how older functions map to newer ones:

   cpu_readmem16, cpu_readmem17, cpu_readmem20,     -> program_read_byte_8
   cpu_readmem21, cpu_readmem24

   cpu_writemem_16bew_word, cpu_writemem18bew_word, -> program_write_word_16be
   cpu_writemem_24bew_word, cpu_writemem32bew_word

   cpu_readport                                     -> io_read_byte_8

A common annoyance used to be that drivers would need to know which of these functions to call in order
to read memory. A table of accessors is now included as part of the memory context switch, which allows
the addition of generic functions that can be used by the drivers to access memory. For example, a driver
trying to read a word from a 68000's address space used to have to call cpu_readmem24bew_word(). Now the
driver can just call program_read_word(), and the memory system will do the right thing.

In addition, there is now a single change_pc() macro used by all CPU cores, regardless of the databus or
address bus width.

Along with these changes, the macros for defining memory maps has changed for consistency as well, as
follows:

   MEMORY_READ_START                -> PROGRAM_READ8_MAP_START
   MEMORY_READ16_START              -> PROGRAM_READ16_MAP_START
   MEMORY_READ32_START              -> PROGRAM_READ32_MAP_START
   MEMORY_WRITE_START               -> PROGRAM_WRITE8_MAP_START
   MEMORY_WRITE16_START             -> PROGRAM_WRITE16_MAP_START
   MEMORY_WRITE32_START             -> PROGRAM_WRITE32_MAP_START
   MEMORY_END                       -> PROGRAM_MAP_END

   PORT_READ_START                  -> IO_READ8_MAP_START
   PORT_READ16_START                -> IO_READ16_MAP_START
   PORT_READ32_START                -> IO_READ32_MAP_START
   PORT_WRITE_START                 -> IO_WRITE8_MAP_START
   PORT_WRITE16_START               -> IO_WRITE16_MAP_START
   PORT_WRITE32_START               -> IO_WRITE32_MAP_START
   PORT_END                         -> IO_MAP_END

Along the way, support has been also added for CPUs with a 64-bit data bus, so there are also macros for
PROGRAM_READ64_MAP_START, etc.

One of the future goals of the memory system is to support not just ranges of memory, but also better
support for mirrors and more complicated situations where addressing is repeated at regular intervals.
In order to facilitate this, macros have been created that must be used when defining a memory map:

   MEMORY_READ_START                                  PROGRAM_READ8_MAP_START
     { 0x0000, 0xffff, MRA_RAM },                  ->   READ_RANGE( 0x0000, 0xffff, MRA8_RAM )
   MEMORY_END                                         PROGRAM_MAP_END

   MEMORY_WRITE_START                                 PROGRAM_WRITE8_MAP_START
     { 0x0000, 0x0fff, MRA_RAM },                       WRITE_RANGE   ( 0x0000, 0x0fff, MRA_RAM )
     { 0x1000, 0x7fff, MRA_RAM, &foo },            ->   WRITE_RANGE_P ( 0x1000, 0x7fff, MRA_RAM, &foo )
     { 0x8000, 0xffff, MRA_RAM, &bar, &bar_size },      WRITE_RANGE_PS( 0x8000, 0xffff, MRA_RAM, &bar, &bar_size )
   MEMORY_END                                         PROGRAM_MAP_END

Since all the memory maps were changing anyway, static 8-bit handlers have been renamed for consistency.
This means that MRA_NOP becomes MRA8_NOP, etc.

Prior versions of MAME allowed special entries in the read/write maps to control the number of effective
address bits. This mechanism has changed so that you can supply an arbitrary combination of flags:

   MEMORY_ADDRESS_BITS(20)          -> PROGRAM_MAP_FLAGS( MEMORY_ABITS(20) )

and it has been enhanced to also allow you to specify the unmapped memory value:
  
   PROGRAM_MAP_FLAGS( MEMORY_UNMAPPED_0 ) /* unmapped reads return all 0's */
   PROGRAM_MAP_FLAGS( MEMORY_UNMAPPED_1 ) /* unmapped reads return all 1's */

Because of this mechanism, the old function memory_set_unmap_value() has been deprecated. All drivers
using this have been updated to use the new mechanism instead. Also note that the MRA_NOP handlers have
been changed to return the unmapped value as well, instead of always returning 0.

Another "feature" that has changed is that unmapped reads and writes to address spaces of less than 20
bits no longer act like RAM. This may break some drivers, but it ends the special treatment of 8-bit
address spaces.

In the machine driver macros, the address space is now explicitly specified:

   MDRV_CPU_MEMORY(read,write)     -> MDRV_CPU_PROGRAM_MAP(read,write)
   /* not applicable */            -> MDRV_CPU_DATA_MAP(read,write)
   MDRV_CPU_PORTS(read,write)      -> MDRV_CPU_IO_MAP(read,write)


CPU Interface Changes
---------------------

The other significant change in this release is the way CPUs are defined and referenced. Previously,
the file cpuintrf.c contained a huge table with many pointers into each CPU, and a bunch of data about
each CPU type. This was problematic to maintain, and left a bunch of data out of the CPU core to be
defined by MAME instead.

The new release defines a new function that every CPU core must implement, of the form:

   <cputype>_get_info(UINT32 state, union cpuinfo *info)

This is the only public function defined for each CPU core. The table in cpuintrf.c now simply consists
of an enumerated index for the CPU type, followed by the pointer to the actual CPU's get_info function.
The flexible get_info function is then responsible for providing pointers to all the remaining functions.
In addition, the number of other functions has been greatly reduced:

   void   set_info(UINT32 state, union cpuinfo *info);
   void   get_context(void *context);
   void   set_context(void *context);
   void   init(void);
   void   reset(void *param);
   void   exit(void);
   int    execute(int cycles);
   void   burn(int cycles);
   offs_t disassemble(char *buffer, offs_t pc);

The old functions get_reg, set_reg, set_irq_line, set_irq_callback, info, get_cycle_table, set_cycle_table
have all been incorporated into get_info and set_info.

All the existing MAME CPU cores have been updated to work with this new system. Also, for most cores, all
functions and the icount global variable have been made static apart from the get_info function. A number
of selectors for get_info/set_info have been defined to return information about the CPU, including the
address and data bus sizes for all address spaces, clock dividers, IRQ line size, context size, etc.

NOTE TO PORTERS: the cpuintrf[] array is now populated dynamically by the cpuintrf_init() function. This
means that if you have informational code or other code that relies on the CPU information being present
(i.e., if you call any of the cputype_* functions) before calling run_game(), you must manually call 
cpuintrf_init() first. Don't worry, it is safe to call cpuintrf_init() multiple times.

DAC Sound in TrucoTron [Tomasz Slanina]

Fixed Graphics and Added Suond to Cross Pang [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added additional unused PROMs to the following [Stefan Jokisch]
	rallyx (rallyx.c)
	acedrvrw (namcos22.c)
	millpac (centiped.c)
	sci (taito_z.c)

Various Updates to the Moon Patrol driver [Stefan Jokisch]
	- added the new PROM dump for the Williams set
	- changed the size of the PROM dump for the IREM set
	- renamed ROMs
	- converted the driver to the tilemap system
	- simplified background drawing by creating a 256x64 gfx layout
	- minor fixes to the video section based on schems

Mobile Suit Gundam EX Revue Fixes [Tomasz Slanina]
	- hooked up EEPROM (68301 parallel port) and added EEPROM initialisation
	- added missing language selection dipswitch

Improvements to ST-V Emulation [Mariusz Wojcieszek]
	- Changes to sprites color calculation. I fixed it using in color bank modes by using color
	  offset register from VDP2. Now shienryu kludge is no longer needed and also sprite colors
	  in Winter Heat and Virtua Fighter Kids are correct.
	- Changes for Princess Clara Daisakusen (prikura) so that game is playable now (as far I
	  tested it).
	- Prikura tried to render distorted sprites with xsize = 0 or ysize = 0 and this caused
	  crash. As these values are prohibited according to manual, I ignore distorted sprites with
	  xsize = 0 or ysize = 0.
        - I found that missing MINIT for slave to run the sprites is done by using address 0x01406f40
	  instead of 0x01000000. I'm not sure if my change is a hack or real hardware behaves in that
	  way, but in my opinion it is possible that whole range of addresses (0x01000000 - 0x017fffff)
	  is used for MINIT. I added MINIT only for one address used by prikura.
	- Bad sprite colors were fixed in point 1.
	- Small change for vdp2: commented out a call to usrintf_showmessage().

Data East MLC Improvements [Bryan McPhail]
	Many aspects of the Video Rendering have been improved, Avengers in Galactic storm is playable
	with some characters now, however there seems to be a CPU core bug affecting various aspects
	of the game, most notably the flipping of Captain America.  Help tracking down and fixing this
	wwould be welcome.  Several Non-Working sets were also added

Update to allow drivers to dynamically change the refresh rate during execution [Aaron Giles]

Namco 8080 Cleanup [Nicola Salmoria]
	- merged geebee.c and warpwarp.c since they are variations of the same hardware design.
	  drivers/geebee.c, machine/geebee.c and vidhrdw/geebee.c are no longer needed.
	- renamed Navalone -> Navarone. I guess that's the correct name, as in "the guns of Navarone".
	- renamed kaitein -> kaitei and kaitei -> kaiteik; made the Namco set the main one. I don't
	  recall if this was already discussed, but I believe kaiteik is a prototype developed by a
	  third party and sold to Namco, where it was completely rewritten.
	- fixed inputs and dip switches in all games.
	- fixed "ball" size in sos and kaitein - the harpoon in kaitein no longer looks like a rock.
	- removed a hack in Warp Warp that didn't draw the ball in the bottom left corner. The flyer
	  confirms that the ball is supposed to be there.

Misc Fixes [Nathan Woods]
	src/chd.c:
    	- Adds workaround for deficiency in Metrowerks compiler

	src/x86drc.c:

Improved Lightgun Code / Reload Handling [Bryan McPhail]
	'-lightgun' now enables the lightgun only - no button remapping is performed.
	'-reload' (formally '-offscreen_reload') is now needed for 2nd button presses
           to map to offscreen shots.
	'-dual' (formally '-dual_lightgun') adds support for the Actlabs Dual Lightgun
           setup, it may be used with and without '-reload' and it requires '-lightgun'. 
           This mode attempts to automatically remap the player 1 & 2 buttons to suit the
           lightgun setup.  If it doesn't work you probably need to delete the .cfg file
           for that game.

	which aren't available on that platform, with their double-precision
	counterparts.  Please let me know if this is a problem, in which case I
	can add some special-case #defines for Solaris

Changed Liberator to use Proms, proper PROMS are not dumped however [Stefan Jokisch]

General Source Changes
----------------------

New CHD format and management tools [Aaron Giles]
	hdcomp is now chdman
	old chd files are _not_ compatible, they will need to be updated
	using chdman -update oldchd.chd newchd.chd
	CHD now stands for 'Compressed Hunks of Data' not 'Compressed
	Hard Drive' as the format is more flexible.

General Source Changes
----------------------

Fix to allow a driver to have MSM6295s and plain ADPCM voices coexist
(required for gcpinbal).  [R.Belmont]
	src/sound/adpcm.c

Full Sound / Music in Grand Cross [R.Belmont]
	src/drivers/gcpinbal.c

Improved Bishi Bashi colours [Angelo Salese]
	src/drivers/bishi.c
	src/palette.c
	src/palette.h

Fixed ckongs sprites [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Updated Double Dragon Driver [Bryan McPhail]
	- Correct video & interrupt timing derived from Xain schematics
	and confirmed on real DD board.

	- Corrected interrupt handling, epecially to MCU (but one
	semi-hack remains).

	- TStrike now boots but sprites don't appear (I had them working
	at one point, can't remember what broke them again).

	- Dangerous Dungeons fixed.

	- World version of Double Dragon added (actually same roms as
	the bootleg, but confirmed from real board)

	- Removed stereo audio flag (still on Toffy - does it have it?)

	src/drivers/ddragon.c

Various ST-V improvements [Angelo Salese]
	src/drivers/stv.c

Twin16/TMNT fixes [Curt Coder]
	drivers/twin16.c

	- Fixed cuebrick NVRAM handler
	- Added watchdog reset

	drivers/tmnt.c

	- Fixed mia/mia2 inputs/dips
	- Fixed visible area in cuebrckj/mia/mia2
	- Changed cuebrckj to "Cue Brick (World version D)", since text
	  is in English)

TMS32031 Fixes [Aaron Giles]
	many fixes to the TMS32031 core; Offroad Challenge is almost playable as a
	result, minus the fact that the clipping plane seems to like clipping out
	the cars during the race. But the terrain problems are fixed at least.

Memory Annoyance Fix [Aaron Giles]
	Unmapped memory accesses always reported the raw byte address, not the
	CPU-level address. This is annoying for chips like the TMS34010 or the
	TMS32031, so now the effecitve offset is logged instead, taking into account
	the address shift.

Some Input Port Corrections [Robin Merrill, fixed by Bryan McPhail]

OSD Fix [Aaron Giles]
	This is a minor fix to enable the OSD for non-debug builds regardless of
	the -debug flag

Misc Fixes [Nathan Woods]
	src/usrintrf.c:
	- Adds a handful of comments to uifontdata[]
	- Changes character 14 to a solid circle; previously this

New games supported or promoted from GAME_NOT_WORKING status
------------------------------------------------------------
Several ST-V games are probably now playable, however be warned many are very very
slow, this is not a bug, sound is still poor or non-existant in most titles, these
haven't been tested for long so could easily fail at later levels.  Games which
were marked as working in previous updates are also improved (shienryu etc.)
	[David Haywood, Angelo Salese, Olivier Galibert]
	Puyo Puyo Sun - some priority glitches, otherwise looks good
	Mausuke Ojama the World - mostly ok
	Ejihon Tantei Jimusyo - missing alpha effect on lens
	Virtua Fighter Kids - bad sprite colours, missing ground effects
	Columns 97 - miscoloured sprites, background not correctly scaled
	Cotton 2 - missing ground in places
	Cotton Boomerang - missing ground in places
	Die Hard Arcade / Dynamite Deka - missing floors / ceilings
	there might be others too, a few can certainly be watched.  this driver still
	needs a lot of work, I don't expect it to be completed soon due to the
	incredible complexity of this hardware.
Sega Dual Space Attack / Head On Dual board [Stefan Jokisch]

	src/sound/scsp.h
	src/sound/scsplfo.c

More ST-V Improvements, fixing various graphical issues (Shienryu Sprite Colours) and

	src/vidhrdw/stvvdp2.c

Some Atari improvements with the new sets (old speed hacks removed that aren't really
needed anymore, both screens being displayed in Cyberball) [Aaron Giles]
	src/ -various, too many to list

Misc Changes [Nathan Woods]
	src/sndintrf.c:
	- Removed wave_sh_stop() call from the MESS specific WAVE sound
	interface (it is extraneous now)

	src/x86drc.c:
	src/x86drc.h:
	- Added a few macros for other miscellaneous X86 opcodes
	- Added a drc_dasm() call, a debug call that uses MAME's I386
	disassembler to disassemble DRC'd code
	(didn't compile, commented out until fixed)

	src/mame.h:
	src/windows/config.c:
	- Added 'GAMENOUN' and 'GAMESNOUN' macros; defined to be the
	human readable text for the words 'game' and 'games' respectively (this
	is so MESS can use the nouns 'system' and 'systems')

v60 Improvements (LDTASK, STTASK, ABSF and some missing \n.) [Olivier Galibert]

Misc Windows OSD updates and D3D fixes [Leon van Rooij]
	makefile:
	windows\windows.mak:
	 Added CFLAGSOSDEPEND variable. It is used when compiling osd code only
	(e.g. DirectX needs -Wno-strict-aliasing).
	 COMPILESYSTEM_CYGWIN determines if nasm or nasmw is used (the cygwin
	version of nasm is called nasm)

	windows\fileio.c:
	 Quick fix for some #defines in that don't work with win32api 2.4

	windows\snprintf.c:
	 Changed a variable name that conflicts with a gcc built-in

	windows\blit.c:
	windows\wind3d.c:
	 Fixed a bug that affected stv games when flipping/rotating the image

	windows\wind3d.c:
	windows\window.c:
	windows\window.h:
 	window size/prescale/rgb-auto effect can now change when the image size is
	changed by the game driver

SegaPCM fixes [Olivier Galibert]
	Fixes the pitch (the 15800Hz value was wrong, it should have been the
	main 4Mhz clock divived by 256) and also makes the code ultra-paranoid
	when it comes to out-of-range accesses in the sample roms.  Power
	Drift's sound code sometimes puts semirandom values for the first
	handful of keyons on song transitions.
	src/sound/segapcm.c

Added Proper Inits to term2la1 [Brian Troha]

for good but it wasn't so if this tests out as ok then I'll probably release 0.76
within a fairly short period of time, if sound has vanished on any games, or anything
that booted in .75 no longer boots let us know, the sooner the better.


General Source Changes

==========================================================================

0.75

General Source Changes
----------------------

TESTDRIVERS still enabled (see note for 0.74u2)

Fixed bug in the time accounting for the V60 which was causing Outrunners to run
with flickering sprites and slow music [Aaron Giles]
	src/cpu/v60/v60.c

Fixed another V60 bug introduced in 0.74u2 which broke the v70 games (and further
broke Outrunners) [Kobat, Olivier Galibert]
	src/cpu/v60/v60.c

Fixed some bugs introduced with the timer system changes a while back [Aaron Giles]
	Hopefully this is the last of them.... Fixes Exterminator and the Atari
	polygon games. Hopefully doesn't break anything in the process.

	src/cpuexec.c
	* changed scanline timing to use floor() to get consistent results
	* fixed bug in time computation if requesting a scanline in the next frame

	src/cpu/tms34010/tms34010.c
	* removed 4x executes per loop which screwed up timing
	* fixed internal interrupt generation to get consistent timing results

	src/timer.c
	* now uses the active callback as a base time when adjusting timers outside
	of a CPU context

	src/drivers/harddriv.c
	src/machine/harddriv.c
	* fixed all the games again, but they are slower now due to more necessary
	interleaving

Fixed Dorachan Orientation [Tomasz Slanina]
	src/drivers/dorachan.c
	src/vidhrdw/dorachan.c

Various Fixes [Nathan Woods]
	src/artwork.c:
	src/artwork.h:
	src/common.c:
	- Fixes a screenshot handling bug that affected Space Invaders

	src/cheat.c:
	- Moves the MESS specific code into a separate module, reducing
	#ifdef clutter

	src/harddisk.c:
	- Moved some variable declarations out of for loops so that it
	can compile in non-GCC compilers

	src/cpu/i86/instr86.c:
	- Fixes REP CMPSW so that it uses words and not bytes

	src/cpuintrf.c:
	src/cpuintrf.h:
	- Adds a call cpuintrf_set_dasm_override() that gives drivers
	the ability to customize disassemblies.  This probably isn't very useful
	for MAME, but it is useful for MESS for things like software interrupts
	used for BIOS calls.

	src/windows/config.c:
	- Increases the size of the buffer used when logerror() output
	goes to OutputDebugString()

	src/windows/config.c:
	src/windows/config.h:
	src/windows/winmain.c:
	- Moves config.c externs to a header file
	- Adds another call, cli_rc_create(), which creates MAME's rc
	struct for use elsewhere.  (I'm actually creating a debug time
	consistency check feature for MAME32, to verify at runtime that the
	arguments that MAME32 has are consistent with MAME's).

	src/rc.c:
	- When rc_destroy() is now called, freed pointers to strings and
	files will now be NULLed out.


Overhauled the Canyon Bomber driver with a number of minor fixes like correct
RAM size and VBLANK duration. [Stefan Jokisch]
	- hiscore reset button added
	- sprite positions should be fixed according to the schems
	- language ROM added (i.e. the language dip works now)
	- prototype set renamed from canbprot to canyonp

Improved Super Chase sample loading [sedn]
	src/drivers/superchs.c

Replaced instances of "inline", "static inline", and "static __inline" with
"INLINE".  This fixes some build problems with  xmame and makes things more
consistent. [Lawrence Gold]
	src/cpu/mips/mips.c
	src/vidhrdw/psx.c
	src/machine/psx.c
	src/drivers/namcos2.c
	src/machine/psx.c
	src/vidhrdw/psx.c

Corrected CPU speeds etc. in snowbros.c [The Guru]
	src/drivers/snowbros.c

Reversed inptport.c changes to 0.74u1 as the version in 0.74u2 wasn't correcly
merged, these will need resubmitting

Some namcos22 Improvements [Phil Stroffolino]
	The major things improved are:
	- fixes to display list processing (affects Prop Cycle ending)
	- gouraud shading
	- misc improvements for the not-working games
	src/drivers/namcos22.c
	src/vidhrdw/namcos22.c

	quite slow now but more accurate.
	src/drivers/zac2650.c
	src/vidhrdw/zac2650.c
Main Event (SNK) [Tomasz Slanina]
	controls probably need work
	src/drivers/mainsnk.c
	src/vidhrdw/mainsnk.c

==========================================================================

0.74u2

General Source Changes
----------------------

The TESTDRIVER system has been removed, all drivers are now enabled working or not,
this decision was made by several members of the development team.  The drivers
that were previously TESTDRIVERS are still marked as GAME_NOT_WORKING so can be
filtered out easily with a front-end.  Please note, the enabling of these drivers
does not indicate they're any closer to working than when they were first added
and in many cases it could still be several years before they work depending on
when they're worked on and how difficult they prove to be.  We're always looking
for talented programmers to work on and improve Mame, some of these drivers could
be a good place to start (others may be near impossible to fix)

If any GAME_NOT_WORKING flags have been missed let us know at Mametesters

graphics [Angelo Salese, David Haywood]
	src/drivers/stv.c

	src/drivers/sdodgeb.c
	src/vidhrdw/sdodgeb.c

Various Changes to keep the code inline with MESS [Nathan Woods]

Added 8 Player Support to the Core [Stefan Jokisch]


New games supported
-------------------
Hanagumi Taisen Columns - Sakura Wars  [Angelo Salese, David Haywood]
	This the first st-v game to be supported by MAME, please note that due
	to the complexity of the system emulation is still preliminary and there
	are still various issues that will need ironing out, there is currently
	no sound.
	src/drivers/stv.c
	src/vidhrdw/stvvdp1.c
	src/vidhrdw/stvvdp2.c
Ultra X Weapons [Tomasz Slanina]
	some gfx offset problems / alignment (sprite handle can move?)
	src/drivers/ssv.c
Twin Eagle 2 [Tomasz Slanina]
	src/drivers/ssv.c
	Twin Eagle 2 DOES NOT WORK due to protection involving the directions
	in which objects travel, and as a side-effect collisions don't work
	correctly either, if somebody fixes this then itmight be fine apart
	from a few offset problems.
Super Trivia Master [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
	wrong colours
	src/drivers/strvmstr.c
Sprint 8 [Stefan Jokisch]
	src/drivers/sprint8.c

Improved Megaplay a bit, the bios screens now show however the games still don't
work [Barry Rodewald]
	src/drivers/segac2.c
	src/includes/segac2.h
	src/vidhrdw/segac2.c

Various ST-V improvements, Hanagumi Columns shows a partial title screen (still
disabled so you'll have to enable it yourself if you want to see)
	[Angelo Salese]
	src/drivers/stv.c

Removed DCS Speed-Ups
	src/sndhrdw/dcs.c

Fixed a bug in the C 68000 core with the SBCD Opcode [Acho A/ Tang]
	States of the sign(N) and overflow(V) flags after SBCD,
	ABCD and NBCD operations are "undefined" according to Motorola.
	The C core randomizes the V flag and sets the N flag like signed
	operations.

	Viofight expects determinant results of the two flags from SBCD
	or it gets stuck in a math loop. The V flag now returns zero and
	the N flag mirrors carry exactly like what the ASM core does.
	src/cpu/m68000/m68k_in.c

Fixed Mustache Boy Continue Screen and attempted to improve speed [Tomasz Slanina]
	src/drivers/mustache.c

Misc Konami Fixes [Acho A. Tang]
	tmnt.c:
	- qgakumon resetting and screen darkening
	- tmnt2 load-save states(not good enough yet)
	- ssriders diagonal jittering(needs testing)

	konamiic.c:
	- boundary conditions and kludge removal in K007420

	rockrage.c:
	- rogue sprites

	kncljoe.c:
	- bad scrolling, clipping, rogue sprites

Couple of Improvements to the Fuuki games (Priority, BG Colours) [Paul Priest]
	src/drivers/fuukifg2.c
	src/vidhrdw/fuukifg2.c
	src/drivers/fuukifg3.c
	src/vidhrdw/fuukifg3.c

Guard against OP_ROM/OP_RAM overflows [Nathan Woods]
	This patch adds an optional facility to guard against OP_ROM/OP_RAM
	overflows.  This is implemented by adding new variables OP_MEM_MIN and
	OP_MEM_MAX that track the minimum and maximum address ranges for which
	using OP_ROM/OP_RAM is valid.

	Support for this feature is enabled via conditional compilation in
	memory.h.  There are three possible modes:

	CPUREADOP_SAFETY_NONE   - The status quo; no range checking at
	all
	CPUREADOP_SAFETY_PARTIAL  - Range checking only against the
	maximum address
	CPUREADOP_SAFETY_FULL     - Range checking against both the
	minimum and the maximum

	This patch has MAME using CPUREADOP_SAFETY_NONE, unless MAME_DEBUG is
	defined in which case CPUREADOP_SAFETY_FULL is set.  Thus as is, this
	patch should have zero effect on release versions of MAME.
	Additionally, being able to safely disassemble code near bank boundaries
	when using the MAME debugger is extremely useful.

	There is a slight performance hit when this is enabled.

Dipswitch Fixes:
	1st dipswitch of 3rd bank in 1941 [Fabrizio Pedrazzini]
	src/drivers/cps1.c

	Tetris Plus 2 (MS32 version) [Sonikos]

	and a few others ...

Changed nkdodgeb to use proms from another Japan bootleg set, maybe this fixes
some problems with the colours.
	src/drivers/nkdodgeb.c

Included 8080 core updates from MESS
	src/cpu/i8085/*

Preliminary Hyperstone Core, not yet working well enough to run anything [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

	src/drivers/fuukifg2.c
	src/vidhrdw/fuukifg2.c

Temporary Fixes to a few of the System 16 driver problems (sound banking for

Change so DIP menu isn't displayed if no Dipswitches are defined in the driver
instead of flashing a blank mneu when you try and enter it [Paul Priest]
	src/usrintrf.c

Various Changes [Nathan Woods]
	src/cpu/jaguar/jaguar.c:
	- Fixed a bug in the NORMI opcode

	src/cpu/mips/mips.c:
	- Removed use of the GCC specific varargs on macros feature

	src/sndhrdw/jaguar.c:
	- Changed around one of the #include paths (due to
	ProjectBuilder on Mac issues)

	src/sound/tms5220.c:
	src/sound/tms5220.h:
	- Added support for the TMS0285 variant (an old variant of the
	TMS5220)

	src/vidhrdw/jagblit.c:
	src/vidhrdw/jaguar.c:
	- Added support for the SRCSHADE and DSTA2 command bits to the
	Jaguar blitter.
	- Added some miscellaneous logging code
	- Changed around one of the #include paths (due to
	ProjectBuilder on Mac issues)

	src/vidhrdw/jagobj.c:

	src/ui_text.h:
	- Added a MESS specific UI string (within #ifdef MESS of course)

	src/usrintrf.c:

	looks like the DIP switch menu can easily be made with different IPT_*
	values (MESS has a configuration menu that functions a lot like the DIP
	switch menu)

	src/artwork.c:
	- Small fix to allow the UI to be drawn if the artwork system is
	active but no artwork is present (not an issue for MAME)

	src/mamedbg.c:
	- Cleanup and fix of set_ea_info() so that negative offsets of 8
	or 16 bits do not have extraneous FF's in front of them.
	- More proper fix to the scanline display bug that prevented
	registers from being edited when the scanline display was on.

	src/cpu/hd6309/6309dasm.c:
	- Better message for when invalid opcodes are disassembled

	src/artwork.c
	src/artwork.h
	- Fixed crashing bug with clones

	src/inptport.c:
	- Adds some MESS specific IPT defaults (within #ifdef MESS)
	- Modified input_port_allocate() so that PORT_BITX declarations
	that specify JOYCODE_a_BUTTONb for their default codes will also get
	JOYCODE_MOUSE_a_BUTTONb or'd in.

	src/input.c:
	src/input.h:
	- Added seq_set_4() and seq_set_5()

Improved Megaplay a bit, the bios screens now show however the games still don't
work [Barry Rodewald]
	src/drivers/segac2.c
	src/includes/segac2.h
	src/vidhrdw/segac2.c

Various ST-V improvements, Hanagumi Columns shows a partial title screen (still
disabled so you'll have to enable it yourself if you want to see)
	[Angelo Salese]
	src/drivers/stv.c

Removed DCS Speed-Ups
	src/sndhrdw/dcs.c

Fixed a bug in the C 68000 core with the SBCD Opcode [Acho A/ Tang]
	States of the sign(N) and overflow(V) flags after SBCD,
	ABCD and NBCD operations are "undefined" according to Motorola.
	The C core randomizes the V flag and sets the N flag like signed
	operations.

	Viofight expects determinant results of the two flags from SBCD
	or it gets stuck in a math loop. The V flag now returns zero and
	the N flag mirrors carry exactly like what the ASM core does.
	src/cpu/m68000/m68k_in.c

Fixed Mustache Boy Continue Screen and attempted to improve speed [Tomasz Slanina]

Misc Konami Fixes [Acho A. Tang]

Guard against OP_ROM/OP_RAM overflows [Nathan Woods]
	This patch adds an optional facility to guard against OP_ROM/OP_RAM
	overflows.  This is implemented by adding new variables OP_MEM_MIN and
	OP_MEM_MAX that track the minimum and maximum address ranges for which
	using OP_ROM/OP_RAM is valid.

	Support for this feature is enabled via conditional compilation in
	memory.h.  There are three possible modes:

	CPUREADOP_SAFETY_NONE   - The status quo; no range checking at
	all
	CPUREADOP_SAFETY_PARTIAL  - Range checking only against the
	maximum address
	CPUREADOP_SAFETY_FULL     - Range checking against both the
	minimum and the maximum

	This patch has MAME using CPUREADOP_SAFETY_NONE, unless MAME_DEBUG is
	defined in which case CPUREADOP_SAFETY_FULL is set.  Thus as is, this
	patch should have zero effect on release versions of MAME.
	Additionally, being able to safely disassemble code near bank boundaries
	when using the MAME debugger is extremely useful.

	There is a slight performance hit when this is enabled.

Changed Fuuki 16-bit driver to use Partial Updates for Raster Effects and enabled
them [David Haywood, Paul Priest]
	src/drivers/fuukifg2.c
	src/vidhrdw/fuukifg2.c

Temporary Fixes to a few of the System 16 driver problems (sound banking for
example)  Note, the driver is still being rewritten these are only minor 'fixes'
to improve things a bit until the rewrite is complete [Acho A. Tang]
	src/drivers/sysetm16.c
	src/vidhrdw/system16.c

Change so DIP menu isn't displayed if no Dipswitches are defined in the driver
instead of flashing a blank mneu when you try and enter it [Paul Priest]
	src/usrintrf.c

Various Changes [Nathan Woods]
	src/cpu/jaguar/jaguar.c:
	- Fixed a bug in the NORMI opcode

	src/cpu/mips/mips.c:
	- Removed use of the GCC specific varargs on macros feature

	src/sndhrdw/jaguar.c:
	- Changed around one of the #include paths (due to
	ProjectBuilder on Mac issues)

	src/sound/tms5220.c:
	src/sound/tms5220.h:
	- Added support for the TMS0285 variant (an old variant of the
	TMS5220)

	src/vidhrdw/jagblit.c:
	src/vidhrdw/jaguar.c:
	- Added support for the SRCSHADE and DSTA2 command bits to the
	Jaguar blitter.
	- Added some miscellaneous logging code
	- Changed around one of the #include paths (due to
	ProjectBuilder on Mac issues)

	src/vidhrdw/jagobj.c:
	- Added support for objects with pitch != 1 for objects with 1-2
	bits per pixels

	src/harddisk.c:
	src/harddisk.h:
	- Added a function to retrieve the interface

	src/ui_text.c:
	src/ui_text.h:
	- Added a MESS specific UI string (within #ifdef MESS of course)

	src/usrintrf.c:
	- Parameterized the setdipswitches() call; so that a menu that
	looks like the DIP switch menu can easily be made with different IPT_*
	values (MESS has a configuration menu that functions a lot like the DIP
	switch menu)

	src/artwork.c:
	- Small fix to allow the UI to be drawn if the artwork system is
	active but no artwork is present (not an issue for MAME)

	src/mamedbg.c:
	- Cleanup and fix of set_ea_info() so that negative offsets of 8
	or 16 bits do not have extraneous FF's in front of them.
	- More proper fix to the scanline display bug that prevented
	registers from being edited when the scanline display was on.

	src/cpu/hd6309/6309dasm.c:
	- Better message for when invalid opcodes are disassembled

	src/artwork.c
	src/artwork.h
	- Fixed crashing bug with clones

	src/inptport.c:
	- Adds some MESS specific IPT defaults (within #ifdef MESS)
	- Modified input_port_allocate() so that PORT_BITX declarations
	that specify JOYCODE_a_BUTTONb for their default codes will also get
	JOYCODE_MOUSE_a_BUTTONb or'd in.

	src/input.c:
	src/input.h:
	- Added seq_set_4() and seq_set_5()

	src/windows/video.c:
	- Changed render_frame() so that throttle_speed() will also be
	called when game_is_paused is set.  This prevents MAME from busy looping
	when paused.

FAQ about new drivers added since 0.71
--------------------------------------

for Run and Gun you must hold down F2 and press F3 to init the Eeprom otherwise
the game won't boot, the rungunu set doesn't work correctly.

Megatech / Megaplay / NSS are preliminary, since the menu system doesn't yet work
perfectly on Megatech I've marked all the games as non-working, Megaplay still
doesn't boot so those are marked as Non-working, and the NSS menu isn't emulated
at all yet so I also consider that to be Non-working, I've enabled these anyway
as it may encourage others to help with the development, Mame is NOT turning into
an emulator for Consoles, these are Arcade systems much like PlayChoice-10.

Outrunners is currently still broken due to problems with the V60 and recent timer
updates, sorry.

The games using the sp0250 sound for speech still need samples for the sound
effects, however samples for the speech are no longer needed with this update.

Various Changes [Nathan Woods]
	src/fileio.c:
	- Introduced a "debug cookie"; when in debug mode, puts a cookie
	value in the mame_file structure to prevent files from being closed
	twice without an assertion

	src/windows/window.c:
	- Fixes a bug in visible area changing in windowed, non-stretch
	mode.  Previously, when the visible area changed, the code would simply
	change the visible area, and look at the resulting window size and tweak
	it accordingly with win_adjust_window().  The problem with this is that
	if you have a sequence where the visible area is made larger, then
	smaller again, what would happen is you wouldn't get the original window
	size; you would simply get the enlarged window with a bunch of buffer
	area.  Now instead of calling win_adjust_window(), I added code that
	preserves the "scale" factors, and the space between the emulation
	rectangle and the window client area.

	src/windows/winddraw.h:
	src/windows/winddraw.c:
	src/windows/wind3d.c:
	- Added a call win_ddraw_fullscreen_margins() that given the
	dwWidth and dwHeight parameters of a DirectDraw surface, comes up with a
	RECT that represents the margins.  For MAME, this is a very simple
	operation (a rectangle from (0,0)-(dwWidth,dwHeight)) (and the
	implementation that I've submitted is corrspondingly simple), but in
	MESS the window can have a menu bar so this operation works differently.
	I've also modified winddraw.c and wind3d.c to use this call.

	src/timer.c:
	src/timer.h:
	- Changes timers so that they are now 'mame_timer *' instead of
	'void *'.  mame_timer is an opaque structure, similar to mame_file in
	fileio.h.  I didn't update any code using timers yet; it doesn't seem to
	me that there isn't a rush and since they used 'void *' before,
	everything compiles just fine.  I hope noone objects to this one.

	src/vidhrdw/jaguar.c:
	- Fixes a potential crash in jaguar_tom_regs_w() (while this
	crash doesn't occur under normal execution of the cojag games though, it
	can occur if modified ROMs are being used).

	src/sound/fmopl.c:
	Added #if/#endif pair

Changed message for Double Clicking on EXE slightly [Leon van Rooij]

Various Sound Improvements to YM2610, YM2608, Y8950 [Jarek Burczynski]
	Inspired by Frits Hilderink (NLMSX emulator author) I attempted to:
	- improve support of the ymdeltat module for the status registers (YM2610,YM2608,Y8950),
	- implement x1bit/x8bit DRAM usage for the ADPCM samples,
	- implement memory read/write via deltat (Y8950 and YM2608)
	- ADPCM synthesis in 'slave' mode (CPU controlled, instead of memory based).

	I made some tests but the changes are quite big so please test them before including. I'm sure the
	Y8950 will be tested by NLMSX authors too.

	- Enhances the hard disk code to support sector sizes other than
	512 bytes (a non-IDE harddisk in MESS for one of the TI systems uses
	this).  src/machine/idectrl.c has been modified to take this into
	account; it requires that HD images be 512 bytes.  The new code is fully
	backwards compatible with old CHDs that do not have a sector size within

0.69u3 (0.69 Update 3)

source diff, changed numbering system to ux instead of a,b,c because people were getting
confused and thinking mame069b.zip (mame 0.69 _b_inary) was the updated version when it
wasn't.

misc fixes and improvements this time, no changes related to the timer system so as far
as testing that goes this isn't an essential upgrade.

if you use this code in your own build of Mame please make sure you use the correct
version number to reflect the inclusion of this updated code.

0.69a (0.69 Update 1)

This version is provided as a source diff only, more releases like this may follow
depending on how this one goes down, the intention is to allow people to have the
latest code without the hassle and bandwidth requirements of a new binary.

If you can't compile this then don't worry, normal releases will still happen, this
doesn't change anything as normal release plans are concerned, please don't hassle
whoever maintains your favourite port of Mame to add the updates here, not everybody
is going to have time to make new binaries on a regular basis.

A number of Changes to the Timer System [Aaron Giles]

	All the CPU scheduling has moved into cpuexec.c and been taken out of
	timer.c. A number of bugs relating to time tracking for suspended CPUs have
	been fixed.

	A side effect of all this is a change in the behavior of the CPU scheduling.
	For the most part, games are fine with this. However, there were a few
	exceptions:

	* taitosj.c: timing of the MCU communication broke
	* arkanoid.c: timing of the MCU communication broke
	* harddriv.c: stunrun timing glitches, racedriv/steeltal/hdrivair broken
	
	(There may be more, but I haven't found them yet.)

	The first two problems have been fixed, as has racedriv, but steeltal,
	hdrivair, and stunrun still have issues.
	
	Oh, one other useful function I added is this:

	   cpu_boost_interleave(double timeslice_duration, double boost_duration);

	You call this if you need to temporarily crank up the interleave for a short
	period of time in order to get CPU synchronization working. I used this in
	arkanoid and taitosj to get the MCU communications working. For example, you
	could say:

	   cpu_boost_interleave(TIME_IN_USEC(1), TIME_IN_USEC(100));

	which would interleave the CPUs on 1 usec boundaries for the next 100 usecs.
	Even more useful is this:

	   cpu_boost_interleave(0, TIME_IN_USEC(10));

	A very small value (0) for the first parameter means "use perfect
	synchronization", which should guarantee cycle-accurate synchronization for
	the specified duration. Note that this is *really* slow, so you don't want
	to be doing it too much!

	Let us know ASAP if anything else is broken as a result of this update

==========================================================================

0.69

Mainly a bugfix release for problems discovered with new features in 0.68,
it also further clears the backlog.  Put together by David Haywood, 

If you submit changes please make sure they're up to date with the latest
source code, if not it means more work for us in sorting them out.

Several people have asked about the SHA1Merger program for updating their
own drivers, if you need this it should be on www.mame.net within a few
hours of this release.

Note, we are aware of some problems with the Direct 3D core which cause
some games to function incorrectly (Rolling Thunder title screen, Hard
Drivin' Dashboard, Puyo Puyo title screen raster etc.) if you have problems
with games when using -d3d try them without before reporting a bug. (although
please do report games broken with -d3d if you find them but make sure to
specify the problem is with -d3d)

The cause of this problem seems to lie somewhere in

result = IDirect3D7_CreateDevice(d3d7, &IID_IDirect3DHALDevice, back_surface, &d3d_device7);

however we don't know how to fix this nor why it happens, could the real problem
be elsewhere?

General Source Changes
----------------------

Fixed a problem with missing 'returns' in the PIC CPU core [Bryan McPhail]
	src\cpu\pic16c5x\pic16c5x.c

Fixed a few MCU simulation problems in bking3 [Angelo Salese]
	src\drivers\bking2.c

Various changes [Nathan Woods]

	src/cheat.c:
	- Minor change to the MESS specific code

	src/datafile.c:
	- DriverDataCompareFunc() is now declared with CLIB_DECL

	src/hash.c:
	- Removed strupr() in favor a manual implementation, because it
	is non-ANSI

	src/usrintrf.c:
	- Minor tweaks within #ifdef MESS code
	- UI code for discrete sound engine now encapsulated within '#if
	HAS_DISCRETE'

	src/ui_text.c:
	src/ui_text.h:
	- Changed some #ifdef MESS specific strings

	src/windows/rc.c:
	src/windows/rc.h:
	- Fixed a potential crash that could occur if the last line in
	an INI file was not terminated with a CRLF
	- Added osd_rc_write(); which does the reverse as osd_rc_read()
	(this is only used in the MESS Win32 port)

	src/fileio.c:
	src/fileio.h:
	- New mame_fputs(), mame_vfprintf() and mame_fprintf() functions
	(used in osd_rc_write()) above
	
	src/windows/fileio.c:
	- Removed some no longer relevant MESS globals
	- Unicode enabled (i.e. - compiles under #define UNICODE)

	(apparently these are already defined on the Mac)

	src/windows/winalloc.c:
	src/windows/winmain.c:
	- Put CLIB_DECL in front of a few declarations


Various Changes [Andrea Mazzoleni]

	src/info.c
	- Substitutes in the -listinfo output the strings "nodump" and "baddump"
	  with "flags nodump" and "flags baddump".

	src/sound/disc_mth.c
	- Substitutes the _HUGE macro with the standard DBL_MAX value
	
	src/cpu/tms9900/9900stat.h
	src/cpu/tms9900/99xxstat.h
	- Adds a test for the GNU C compiler to skip some POWERPC inline assembler
	  not compatible with the GNU assembler format.

	src/x86drc.h
	- Fixes some macros with arguments not used. Otherwise it doesn't compile
	  with gcc 2.95.3.

Auditing Fixes for cases where no good dump is known but a file is found [BUT]
	src\audit.c
	
Improvements and Bug Fixes to the Direct 3D Blitting [Leon van Rooij]

	-effect same as 0.68 and earlier, no effect on d3d module
	-zoom or -z (default is 2) select zoom level, works for the ddraw code as well
	find the smallest display mode that will fit an n times zoomed game image
	(only used when no display mode is explicitly forced,
	the d3d code takes the aspect ratio into account, ddraw behaviour is 
	unchanged)
	-cleanstretch or -cs only strecth to integer ratios, works for the ddraw 
	code as well

	-d3dfilter or -d3dflt select filtering algorithm
	0 is none, 1 bi-linear, 2 flat bi-cubic, 3 gaussian bicubic, 4 anisotropic
	-d3deffect behaves exactly the same as -effect, but only affects the d3d module
	You can use all -effect parameters, so none, scan25, scan50, scan75,
	rgb16, rgb6, rgb4, rgb3, and sharp work, they are identical at 2x zoom
	scan75v and rgb4v also work, and are identical to scan75 adn rgb4
	(as the d3d effects are automatically rotated already)
	Additionally, all effects presets and auto work
	none affects only the presets now.
	The presets are renamed, in addition to the -effect presets, they are now:
	rgbminmask,
	dotmedmask,
	rgbmedmask,
	rgbmicro
	rgbtiny
	aperturegrille,
	dotmedbright,
	rgbmaxbright

	-d3dscan scanline intensity, 100 is off
	-d3dfeedback feedback intensity, 0 is off
	-d3dsaturate oversaturation intensity, 0 is off
	-d3dprescale AKA sharp.
	-d3dcustom custom preset, as before
	(anyone who wants to customise presets can, everybody else should ignore it)
	-d3dexpert Normal users should not use this one, basically if you can't 
	read the
	source to figure out what it does, you have no business using it <g>
	Behaves as -effect did in the previous updates, plus some new stuff;
	disable disables all effects,
	prescale lets you control prescale explicitly,
	pixelcounter changes the scanline texture
	(use mame whatever -z 4 -d3d -cs -flt 0 -d3dexpert pixelcounter),
	norotate disables rotating effects
	
	It has it's own ini section and it handles priorities itself to ensure 
	correct behaviour. For custom presets, patterns are no longer loaded from 
	the effects directory, the name should just include the path.
	
	There are warning messages when you do e.g. -nod3d -d3dscan50, or -d3d 
	-effect sharp (although the latter will work as it has up until 0.68). It 
	tests all hardware capabilities it should (as far as I'm aware, at least). 
	It won't chop textures in 256x256 blocks for old Voodoo cards. 
	-texture_management is now enabled by default as leaving it off seems to 
	have worse consequences for more people than having it on. I haven't added 
	a workaround for cards that can't render to textures yet, other than that, 
	any possible typos, etc. or any suggestions people may have, it should be 
	good for 0.69.
	
	Apparently some videocards don't like the DX7 pageflip in combination with 
	a triple buffer. (behaviour when triple buffering is unchanged from 0.67, 
	that goes for the d3d code as well as the ddraw code).

Fixed Interrupt being triggered on Non-Existant CPU for TaitoSJ games with no
MCU [Aaron Giles]
	src\machine\taitosj.c
	
Added -bios option [Paul Priest]

Adds the system option "bios". An integer that is valid where: 0 <= n < 15

	Rom loading is now modified so that if any of the 4 bits in
	ROM_BIOSFLAGSMASK of the rom flags are set, it will only be loaded if
	the value+1 == options.bios

	NeoGeo has been modified to take advantage of this as follows:
	0 - "sp-s2.sp1"    - Europe, 1 Slot (also been seen on a 4 slot) (default)
	1 - "sp-s.sp1"     - Europe, 4 Slot
	2 - "usa_2slt.bin" - US, 2 Slot
	3 - "sp-e.sp1"     - US, 6 Slot (V5?)
	4 - "asia-s3.sp1"  - Asia S3 Ver 6
	5 - "vs-bios.rom"  - Japan, Ver 6 VS Bios
	6 - "sp-j2.rom"    - Japan, Older
	
	Note that using a value >6 and <15 will result in NO bios rom being
	loaded (And a red screen in NeoGeo's case).

Fixed FM bug causing bad sounds in maglord and other games which was introduced in
the last release [Jarek Burczynski]

Discrete Sound update for several games [Derrick Renaud]

	- Atari Baseball - added video invert (triples/home runs).
	- Avalanche - changed to discrete sounds adding missing top rocks sound
	(Aud0 trigger). (and yes the game is supposed to sound horrible)
	- Dominos - added 60Hz ac signal (but it does not seem to affect anything).
	- Drag Race - added discrete sounds.
	- Night Driver - added discrete sounds and video invert during crash.
	Motor/skid sounds are not 100% correct.
	- Sprint 2 - switched player controls so they lined up under the proper
	score color.
	- Orbit - added discrete sounds.

	- [but] fixed the 'no stereo' bug in src\sound\discrete.c
	- I also fixed a minor bug in src\sound\discrete.h causing
	DISCRETE_LOGIC_INVERT not to work.
	- And did minor code cleanup to Basketball.
	- Removed GAME_IMPERFECT_SOUND flag from Circus.  If correct samples are
	used then it is ok, like all sample games.  (New accurate samples have been
	posted at twisty's)

General Source Changes
----------------------

SHA1 hash support, including various new command line options [Farfetch'd]
	src\too many to list ;-)

Mame Blitter Generation Code [Phil Stroffolino]
	src\mameblit.c
	src\mame.c
	src\mame.h
	src\drawgfx.c
	src\blitgen.c

Basic Direct3D blitting support [Leon van Rooij]

You need DirectX7 headers and libs to compile it, I'm using the set from
http:\\caesar.logiqx.com\html\tools\compilers\mingw.shtml which has the
original MS headers (the same set is used for Allegro and FB Alpha) and
I've made a minor update to the ddraw code so that it compiles with this
set of headers (VC++ should still be fine as well).

The code manually imports the DirectDrawCreateEx() function so MAME
compiled with d3d support will (or rather should, I've not actually tested
that yet) still run on PC's with older versions of DirectX. It should work
with pretty much any 3D hardware (except perhaps older Voodoo-based cards),
and the speed should be similar to the DirectDraw blit (a bit faster for
some older cards).

-direct3d or -d3d: use Direct3D (default is off, overrides -dd);
-filter or -flt: use bi-linear filtering (default is on);
-texture_management: use DirectX texture management (default is off, but
 some 3D cards need this (however, there's a small-ish speed-penalty)).

- Partially simulated the protection in Birdie Try [Angelo Salese]

- Improved decryption in Quiz F1 1-2 Finish, it's still incomplete though.
  [Angelo Salese]

- Fixed ball position recognition in Golfing Greats. [Olivier Galibert]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- New options -nodisclaimer and -nogameinfo to disable startup screens.
  Warnings about incorrect emulation are not disabled. [Aaron Giles]

- Replaced RDTSC timing with QueryPerformanceCounter. This should fix problems
  on SpeedStep notebooks. It seems, however, that it causes even worse problems
  on other machines. Therefore, the old behaviour can be forced with the new
  -rdtsc option. [smf]


Source:
-------

- Now compiled with MinGW 2.0/GCC 3.2. There might be bugs caused by the new
  compiler, let us know.

- All new, much better, YM2413 emulation. [Jarek Burczynski]

- Drum support in YM2608 emulation (check e.g. Tail 2 Nose). [Jarek Burczynski]

- Moved most of the file I/O out of the OS depndant code and into the core.
  Added two new types, mame_file and osd_file, which enforce better type
  checking throughout the system (and prevents confusing the two).
  Instead of calling osd_fopen, osd_fread, osd_fwrite, etc., you now call
  mame_fopen, mame_fread, mame_fwrite, etc. The osd_* calls are reserved
  to the core.
  All the ZIP handling is done in the mame_file functions, so it will be
  inherited by all ports.
  [Aaron Giles]

- [Win32] The diff, snap, cfg, nvram, etc. directories are created
  automatically if they don't exist the first time MAME tries to create a file
  there. [Aaron Giles]

- MIPS III/IV CPU cores. [Aaron Giles]

- ADSP-2115 CPU support. [Aaron Giles]

- TMS32025 CPU core. [Quench]

- Fixed YMF278B emulation. [R.Belmont]

Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Light gun support. [Bryan McPhail]


Source:
-------

- Important for porters: major redesign of the OS interface for display update.
  - VIDEO_SUPPORTS_DIRTY flag removed
  - osd_mark_dirty() removed
  - osd_create_display() now takes an extra parameter rgb_components
  - osd_set_visible_area() removed
  - osd_allocate_colors() removed
  - osd_modify_pen() removed
  - osd_update_video_and_audio() now takes a mame_display pointer
  - osd_debugger_focus() removed
  - osd_set/get_gamma() removed
  - osd_set/get_brightness() removed
  [Aaron Giles]

- Completely redesigned the artwork handling. Any game can now use artwork,
  with no specific support in the driver. Configuration is done with external
  .art files. [Aaron Giles]
  -[no]artcrop -- crops artwork to the game screen area only
  -[no]backdrop -- enables/disables backdrop art
  -[no]overlay -- enables/disables overlay art
  -[no]bezel -- enables/disables bezel art

- The Windows version now rotates the screen at blit time instead of requiring
  the core to do so. Since the new code is usually faster than the old one, and
  it allows for great simplifications in the core, rotation at blit time will
  probably be a requirement in next release. Porters are advised to begin
  implementing it now. [Aaron Giles]

Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [windows] New blitting effect "-effect sharp". This gives a sharper image
  than the default. [John IV]


Source:
-------

- New macros have been added to declare common callback functions and enforce
  naming conventions. All drivers have been converted to the new macros:

      void init_drivername()            -> DRIVER_INIT( name )
      int generate_int()                -> INTERRUPT_GEN( func )
      void name_init_machine()          -> MACHINE_INIT( name )
      void nvram_handler()              -> NVRAM_HANDLER( name )
      void name_vh_convert_color_prom() -> PALETTE_INIT( name )
      int name_vh_start()               -> VIDEO_START( name )
      void name_vh_stop()               -> VIDEO_STOP( name )
      void name_vh_eof()                -> VIDEO_EOF( name )
      void name_vh_screenrefresh()      -> VIDEO_UPDATE( name )

- Major change to the way machine drivers are set up. A series of macros is
  now available (defined in driver.h) to "build up" a machine driver. The
  ordering of items in the machine driver is arbitrary, apart from CPU-specific
  data, which is tied to the most-recently referenced CPU. With this new format,
  machine drivers can now be built by modifying another machine driver,
  providing a primitive inheritance mechanism. See any driver for an example
  of the new format. See mcr.c for a more complex example of inheritance.

- New functions auto_bitmap_alloc() and auto_bitmap_alloc_depth() are now
  available to create automatically managed bitmaps. Combined with auto_malloc(),
  there is no need for a video_stop function in most cases. All existing
  drivers have been modified to take advantage of these features.

- The old interrupt system has now been made officially obsolete. This means
  that the function cpu_cause_interrupt() is no longer available; you must use
  cpu_set_irq_line() or cpu_set_irq_line_and_vector() instead. It also means
  that a number of old/conflicting constants have been removed. In addition,
  interrupt generation callbacks for CPUs no longer return an IRQ line or
  vector. Instead, the interrupt callback must actively cause the interrupt
  via cpu_set_irq_line(). All existing drivers have been updated to these
  changes.

- New interrupt callback functions: nmi_line_pulse(), nmi_line_assert(),
  irqn_line_hold(), irqn_line_pulse(), irqn_line_assert(). These functions
  replace the old interrupt() and nmi_interrupt() callbacks and can be used
  directly as interrupt callbacks.

- The function tilemap_set_clip() has been removed. In its place, there is a
  new 'cliprect' parameter to tilemap_draw(). All existing drivers have been
  updated to support this change.

- In preparation for partial updating support, the parameters to video_update
  have changed. A new parameter 'cliprect' has been added, which should be
  honored. In the future, the parameter will contain the subset of the screen
  to render; for now, it just contains Machine->visible_area. In addition,
  the 'full_refresh' parameter is gone; update functions must always redraw
  the requested portion of the bitmap. Some drivers have been updated to fully
  support the cliprect; others still need to be updated.

- Two new functions have been added to the timer system. timer_create() creates
  a new "permanent" timer, and timer_adjust() adjusts the scheduling of that
  timer. This is now the only way to dynamically manipulate a timer. The old
  functions timer_set() and timer_pulse() are still around, but they no longer
  return a handle to the timer they create. Timers created with timer_create()
  should be created at initialization time, not dynamically. Timers also now
  participate in the automatic resource tracking, so there is no need to
  explicitly dispose of them. All existing drivers have been updated with the
  necessary changes.

- Basic generic NVRAM handlers have been added. For a number of games, it is
  sufficient to point the global variables 'generic_nvram' and
  'generic_nvram_size' to the location and size of the NVRAM area. In the
  machine driver, you can now specify 'generic_0fill' or 'generic_1fill' to
  request a generic NVRAM handler. The 0fill and 1fill refer to how the memory
  is initialized in the absence of an .nv file.

- The following old functions and macros have now been fully deprecated:

     cpu_get_pc()           -> activecpu_get_pc()
     cpu_get_sp()           -> activecpu_get_sp()
     cpu_getpreviouspc()    -> activecpu_get_previouspc()
     cpu_get_reg()          -> activecpu_get_reg()
     cpu_set_reg()          -> activecpu_set_reg()
     cpu_set_op_base()      -> activecpu_set_op_base()
     cpu_get_pc_byte()      -> activecpu_get_pc_byte()
     READ_WORD              -> (no equivalent)
     WRITE_WORD             -> (no equivalent)

- New function force_partial_update(), call this to force a partial update to
  occur up to and including the specified scanline. [Aaron Giles]

- ARM CPU emulation [Bryan McPhail, Phil Stroffolino]

0.53

We have abandoned the "beta" numbering scheme, which was becoming pointless.
The current version is 0.53 because 0.36 (the last "non-beta" release) + .16
(the number of "beta" releases since then) = 0.52.

  [Fabrice Frances]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- The Windows port is now called "MAME" (instead of "MAMEW"). The DOS port is
  called "DMAME".

- [Windows] CLI improvements:
  * config option for steadykey (default: OFF)
  * parse debug.ini in debug builds
  * mamew \anywhere\roms\pacman.zip works
  * improved -log option
  * mame will now parse argv[0].ini instead of mame.ini.
    i.e. if the mame executable is called "m37b17.exe" it will
    parse m37b17.ini instead of mame.ini
  [Paul Priest, Bernd Wiebelt]

- [DOS] Support for C64/Atari/Sinclair joysticks connected via DB9 or
  Turbografix interface. [Aley Keprt]


Source:
-------

- Big changes to the palette system. 8-bit modes are no longer supported, only
  16-bit ones are used. 8-bit support may be removed from the OS dependant
  code; the core will never ask for an 8-bit deep screen. 8-bit bitmaps could
  still be used though.

- Palette compression has been removed. palette_recalc(), palette_transparent_pen
  and palette_used_colors[] are not available anymore. Drivers that relied on
  PALETTE_COLOR_TRANSPARENT for transparency effects must be rewritten to
  implement them differently. As a result of this, all games using the Taito
  TC0480SCP video chip, and all Taito F3 games, are broken in this release.

- tilemap_update() is gone. Everything is handled by tilemap_draw().

- IMPORTANT CHANGE FOR PORTERS: the OS dependant code is now required to
  guarantee, in 16-bit palettized mode, that Machine->pens[i] == i. The "pens"
  argument to osd_allocate_colors() will be NULL, actually it has been renamed
  "rgb_components" since direct RGB modes are the only ones that will pass that
  argument.

- Remove VIDEO_MODIFIES_PALETTE and the "modifiable" parameter from
  osd_allocate_colors().

- New flags VIDEO_HAS_SHADOWS and VIDEO_HAS_HIGHLIGHTS that automatically extend
  the palette creating a darker(brighter copy for shadows handling.
  palette_set_shadow_factor() and palette_set_highlight_factor() allow to
  control the adjustment to apply (shadow can be > 1.0, making it an highlight,
  and highlight can be < 1.0 making it a shadow - the names are just conventional).
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- New function palette_set_brightness(), allowing selective control of palette
  brightness independently of the palette RAM contents. [Nicola Salmoria]

- MachineDriver.color_table_len can now be 0, meaning that the colortable is a
  1:1 mapping from the palette. Note that you CANNOT use this feature if you use
  TRANSPARENCY_COLOR; but of course, if you need TRANSPARENCY_COLOR you'll not
  have a 1:1 colortable.

- New function tilemap_draw_roz(). [Phil Stroffolino]

- New function auto_malloc(); this is the same as malloc(), but the memory is
  automatically freed when the driver exits. [Aaron Giles]

- osd_bitmap.line is now a void ** to prevent confusion.

- All new set of functions for alpha blending support, used in Xexex.
  Porters: you have to support direct mapped 15 and 32 bits video modes. Remember
  to update osd_alloc_bitmap() too! See osdepend.h for the changes in
  osd_create_display() and osd_allocate_colors(). [Olivier Galibert]

- draw_crosshair(). [Nicola Salmoria]

- GAME_IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS flag for game drivers.

- Standalone YM2413 emulator, giving much better sound in e.g. Pang.
  [Mitsutaka Okazaki, Sean Young]

- [DOS] Now compiled with Allegro WIP 3.9.34, this fixes problems with the
  Sidewinder gamepad. GNU Binutils 2.9.5.1 might also be needed to compile.

- New filtering code for the audio mixer. It is applied to audio streams
  generated at a sampling rate different from the sound card's one, improving
  quality. Some examples with a very audible difference are: fantasy, polyplay,
  galaxian (the background effect when playing), nibbler, vanguard and all the
  Seta games.

  [DOS] The "resamplefilter" option can be used to turn the filtering off.

0.37 BETA 9

A handful of drivers haven't been converted to the new memory API yet, and therefore
don't work. On startup, they will give the error
      cpu # uses wrong data width memory handlers!
and refuse to start.


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed last two levels in Act Fancer. [Bryan McPhail]


Source:
-------

- Major rewrite of the memory interface.
  The interface to the system is nearly identical, but the core has been
  rewritten. Input ports are now handled just like memory accesses. Input ports
  are also the same width as memory for a given CPU. For example, a 16-bit CPU
  now needs both 16-bit memory handlers and 16-bit port handlers. Interfaces
  for 16-bit and 32-bit port handlers have been added.

  New macros exist now for generating and declaring a set of memory handlers.
  This makes it very easy to add a new address space. The "voodoo constants"
  ABITS1_xx, ABITS2_xx and ABITSMIN_xx are no longer necessary.

  The number of supported banks has been expanded to 24. The
  memory_set_bankhandler_* functions now take an additional parameter which
  serves as an additional offset into the memory space. The namcos1 driver
  has been modified to take advantage of these features.

  It is now possible to manually limit the number of active address bits by
  using a special MEMPORT_SET_BITS() macro in the read or write memory
  definitions. See the rpunch driver for an example (Rabio Lepus only maps
  the low 20 bits of the 68000's 24-bit address space.)

  A new function cpu_get_pc_byte returns the byte offset of the current CPU's
  PC, adjusted for Harvard architecture CPUs and CPUs which track the PC at the
  bit or word level.

  Several functions and macros have been renamed. All drivers have been updated
  accordingly:

      cpu_setbankhandler_*  -> memory_set_bankhandler_*
      cpu_setOPbaseoverride -> memory_set_opbase_handler
      memoryswapcontext     -> memory_set_context
      cpu_readport          -> cpu_readport16
      cpu_writeport         -> cpu_writeport16
      change_pc             -> changepc_16

  [Aaron Giles]

- Major rewrite of the ROM loading interface.
  The previous ROM loading system was showing its limitations, and was often
  the source of confusion about byte ordering. The new system attempts to
  address these concerns. All drivers have been converted to use the new
  system exclusively; the old macros are deprecated immediately.

  The ROM_REGION macro now takes a third parameter, which holds the various
  flags for the region. These flags have been expanded to describe the data
  width and endianness of the region (except for CPU regions, which obtain
  their width and endianness from the associated CPU). This information is
  used after the region has been loaded in order to appropriately byte-
  swap the data for the native endianness of the target platform.

  Additional region flags are now provided: ROMREGION_INVERT performs a
  logical NOT on all data in the region. And ROMREGION_ERASE can be used to
  clear the region to a specific byte value before loading ROMs.

  For ROM loading, the old collection of ROM_LOAD_XXX_EVEN/ODD macros is
  gone. To load a ROM into every other byte in a region, use the new macro
  ROM_LOAD16_BYTE. All data should now be loaded in the natural alignment and
  endianness of the region. Only after the ROMs are loaded will the data
  be modified to correspond to what the CPU needs.

  If you are loading data for a CPU into a non-CPU region (for example, you
  are loading 68000 code into REGION_USER1), you need to make sure to tag
  the region the same as the CPU. For a user region containing 68000 code,
  you should use the ROM_REGION16_BE() macro to declare the region. This
  isn't necessary for REGION_CPUxx because the ROM loader automatically
  determines the information it needs from the CPU interface.

  If you have old drivers to convert, these conversions cover 99% of all
  cases (the (0) or (1) indicates that the offset field should be an even
  (0) or an odd (1) address):

      ROM_LOAD_EVEN         -> ROM_LOAD16_BYTE(0)
      ROM_LOAD_ODD          -> ROM_LOAD16_BYTE(1)
      ROM_LOAD_WIDE         -> ROM_LOAD16_WORD
      ROM_LOAD_WIDE_SWAP    -> ROM_LOAD16_WORD_SWAP

      ROM_LOAD_GFX_EVEN     -> ROM_LOAD16_BYTE(0)
      ROM_LOAD_GFX_ODD      -> ROM_LOAD16_BYTE(1)
      ROM_LOAD_GFX_SWAP     -> ROM_LOAD16_WORD_SWAP

      ROM_LOAD_V20_EVEN     -> ROM_LOAD16_BYTE(1)
      ROM_LOAD_V20_ODD      -> ROM_LOAD16_BYTE(0)
      ROM_LOAD_V20_WIDE     -> ROM_LOAD16_WORD

  These new macros are built upon a more flexible collection of ROM-
  loading operations. ROM data is now loaded in "groups" of 1-16 bytes,
  with 0-15 bytes of empty space left between each group. The data in
  each group can be loaded in standard order, or in reversed order. And
  each byte of data loaded can be masked and shifted to blend with other
  data that has been previously loaded.

  Furthermore, since almost every ROM_RELOAD and ROM_CONTINUE was used to
  load the ROM with the exact same parameters, these macros now inherit
  the behavior of the previous operation. This eliminates the need for
  ROM_RELOAD_GFX_EVEN and all the other macros that cluttered up the old
  system. For example, if you use ROM_LOAD16_BYTE to load some data, and
  follow it with a ROM_CONTINUE to load additional data at a separate
  offset, the ROM loader will continue loading every other byte.

  Finally, there are two new entries that can be used to help fill in
  unused or duplicated ROM data:

      ROM_FILL( offset, length, byteval)
      ROM_COPY( source_region, source_offset, offset, length )

  ROM_FILL simply clears blocks of a region to a specific byte value.
  ROM_COPY can be used to copy previously-loaded data from the same or
  another region.
  [Aaron Giles]

- The 68EC020 core now uses 32-bit memory handlers. The Psikyo driver has been
  updated to use the new interface. Unfortunately, this support has yet to make
  it into the x86 asm 68000 core, so it is once again disabled for this build.
  [Aaron Giles]

- The CCPU and TMS32C010 cores are now full 16-bit cores. Appropriate changes
  to the drivers that use them have already been made. This fixes the input
  ports on the Cinematronics games, and gameplay in several Toaplan games.

  [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have improved SOUND:
----------------------------------

- Preliminary sound in Blade Master, Gunforce, UUCops and Lethal Thunder.
  [Bryan McPhail]


Source:
-------

- Major changes to the memory interface.
  Drivers must use the new MEMORY_READ_START etc. macros, and for 16-bit CPUs
  the API is completely changed: the new READ16_HANDLER, WRITE16_HANDLER
  function types must be used for memory handlers. The macros READ_WORD(),
  WRITE_WORD() etc. are obsolete: handlers must directly access 16-bit wide
  arrays (use data16_t * instead of the old unsigned char *); always use the
  new macro COMBINE_DATA() to store data in the arrays correctlyhandling 8-bit
  wide memory accesses. Use ACCESSING_MSB and ACCESSING_LSB to know if the
  specified byte is being accessed (necessary for 8-bit wide external hardware).
  You no longer have to use MRA_BANKx for sparse RAM areas, you can use MRA_RAM
  just like with the 8-bit games.

  A handful of drivers haven't beenconverted to the new API yet, and therefore
  don't work. On startup, they will give the error
  cpu # uses wrong data width memory handlers!
  and refuse to start.

  The cheat system might be broken for 16-bit CPUs (untested).
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Changes to the tilemap API:
  - tilemap_render() is obsolete
  - struct tilemap is private - can't be accessed directly
  - tilemap_set_transparent_pen() and tilemap_set_transmask() replace direct
    poking in the tilemap
  - tilemap_mark_all_pixels_dirty() is obsolete (replaced by
    tilemap_dirty_palette() which is automatically called by palette_recalc())
  - additional parameter to tilemap_draw() to specify the priority mask to be
    stored in the priority buffer
  [Phil Stroffolino]

- Removed palette_transparent_color which is no longer needed by any driver.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Removed the "ui" parameter from osd_mark_dirty(). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Removed osd_clearbitmap(). The correct way to black the screen in drivers
  is, and has always been, fillbitmap(). osd_alloc_bitmap() no longer has to
  clear the bitmap (it isn't necessary since it's cleared by the drivers
  anyway).
  extern int need_to_clear_bitmap removed as well; use schedule_full_refresh()
  instead (clearing the bitmap is not necessary because drivers are required to
  redraw the whole screen when full_refresh is 1). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Rewritten the Nec CPU core, with correct timing and support for encryption.
  [Bryan McPhail]

- Preliminary Irem GA20 sound emulation. [Bryan McPhail]

- The profiler also watches memory read and write handlers. They were
  previously cumulated with the CPU emulation.
  Also, the profiler is now disabled in non-debug builds because the
  performance hit is quite noticeable. [Nicola Salmoria]

- The x86 asm 68000 core now has limited 68020 support and runs the Psikyo
  games, so is reenabled by default. [Darren Olafson]

0.37 BETA 7

-- FIRST, A WORD FROM OUR SPONSOR --

Some time ago I (Nicola) mistakenly removed Lotto Fun because I thought it was
a gambling machine. After some more careful evaluation, it is evident that
this is a game of skill, therefore it is now supported again. This was my
mistake and I apologize for that.

As a reminder, the exclusion of gambling machines is purely technical, not
moral or legal. Gambling machines are not video games, and just like MAME
doesn't support mechanical pinballs (but it supports software pinballs), it
also doesn't support gambling machines (but it supports games with a gambling
theme). Both mechanical pinballs and gambling machines can be found in the
same places where video games are; this doesn't make them all the same thing.
The distinction between gambling machines and video games is not arbitrary:
gambling machines usually require more money to play than a video game (e.g.
10 tokens to start), and they have settings that allow the operator to decide
how much of the money that comes in should come out. No amount of skill can
improve a player's chances of winning: this is entirely predetermined by the
machine.

-- WE NOW RETURN YOU TO YOUR USUAL PROGRAMMING --


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Stars in Strider and Forgotten Worlds. [Nicola Salmoria, Tim Lindquist]

- Fixed sprite/tile priority in Black Tiger. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed startup garbage in Vastar. [Zsolt Vasvari]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed the Pokey emulation so that the Tempest reset bug is fixed, this time
  for real and forever. [Juergen Buchmueller]


Source:
-------

- Important for porters: changes to the dirty marking system. The blitting
  code was previously required to support two types of dirty marking: a
  "correct" one, used for vector games, where only the screen portions marked
  dirty during the current frame should be copied to the video card; and a
  "wrong" one, relying on a hack, where the blitter was also required to
  remember the dirty regions from *previous* frame, and copy those as well.
  Only the "correct" one is left, which should somewhat simplify dirty
  handling in the OS dependant code. Moreover, the code must not check for
  VIDEO_TYPE_VECTOR to know whether to use dirty marking: it must check only
  VIDEO_SUPPORTS_DIRTY, which is set for vector games.

- Important for porters: the HAS_XXX constants for cpu and sound emulation are
  no longer #defined in cpuintrf.h if they were not already defined. They are
  set by the makefile (rules.mak). If you are not using that in your port,
  you'll have to make sure that all constants are initialized somewhere.

- Removed osd_led_w(); instead, an additional leds_status parameter is passed
  to osd_update_video_and_audio(). Drivers now have to use set_led_status().

- [DOS] The makefile now uses GNUs mkdir instead of the built-in one. If you
  don't have mkdir you  can find it here:
  http://www.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/gnuish/gnufut21.zip

- Added VIDEO_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO_2_1, this should be honored by the OS
  dependant code just like VIDEO_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO_1_2.

- Backdrops are handled by the core like overlays, specific support in the
  drivers is no longer necessary. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

- I hope you didn't throw away unused PROMs from your archives.


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Instead of the internal game name, you can use on the command line
  the .zip file name, it can also include path, so for example
  MAME G:\MyBoards\pacman.zip
  will be equivalent to
  MAME pacman -rompath G:\MyBoards
  [David Widel]

- [DOS] The makefile now uses rm instead of deltree. If you don't have rm you
  can find it here: http://www.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/gnuish/gnufut21.zip

- TMS5110 emulator, used by Bagman. [Jarek Burczynski]

- Several changes to have the debugger run in the game screen under DOS.
  The debugger display is now entirely rendered in the core using a standard
  bitmap, instead of relying on the OS dependant code to simulate a character
  mapped display.
  Changes affecting porters are:
  osd_set_display() removed
  osd_set_screen_size() removed
  osd_screen_update() removed
  osd_wait_keypress() removed
  osd_debugger_focus() added
  osd_dbg.h removed
  osd_update_video_and_audio() has extra debug_bitmap argument
  osd_allocate_colors() has parameters for the debugger palette
  mamedbg.c no longer requires clock_t and clock()
  It's entirely up to the OS dependant code what to do with the game and debug
  bitmaps. They can be shown one at a time (giving the user a means to switch
  between them), or in two separate windows. osd_debugger_focus() is used to
  request that one of the two bitmaps be made visible to the user.
  Under DOS, you can switch at any time between the game and debugger display
  by pressing F5.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Removed osd_poll_joysticks(). Ports requiring polling of the joystick can do
  so in osd_update_video_and_audio().

0.37 BETA 4

PORTERS: THERE ARE A FEW API CHANGES, READ CAREFULLY THE SOURCE SECTION.


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Background smoothing in Return of the Jedi. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Greatly improved Star Fire / Fire One. [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed final fireworks in Ajax. [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have improved SOUND:
----------------------------------

- Fixed sound in the Exidy games. [Aaron Giles]

- Improved YM2413 emulation. [Paul Leaman]


Source:
-------

- [DOS] The SEAL patch was bugged on mono sound cards, a new one is included.

- Fixed save_screen_snapshot() to save VIDEO_PIXEL_ASPECT_RATIO_1_2 games with
  the correct aspect ratio. Also introduced save_screen_snapshot_as(). Porters
  are STRONGLY ADVISED to use one of these functions to save screen shots,
  instead of providing their own. Note that osd_save_snapshot() now takes a
  bitmap argument, so it must not be hardwired to save Machine->scrbitmap
  (overlays wouldn't be saved otherwise). [nathan]

- A few changes were made to allow run time changes to the visible area, and
  to simplify the OS dependant code by moving some functionality to the core.
  - Added visible_area to struct RunningMachine. Drivers must now use
    Machine->visible_area instead of Machine->drv->visible_area. The field in
    struct MachineDriver has been renamed default_visible_area and it should
    normally be used by the core only.
  - New function set_visible_area() that can be used by drivers to change the
    active display area at run time.
  - New function osd_set_visible_area() used to tell the OS dependant code the
    portion of the bitmap that has to be drawn on screen. It is passed
    coordinates relative to the actual bitmap, so no further processing is
    required for rotated games. The OS dependant code is allowed to display a
    smaller portion of the bitmap if necessary, but it must not draw a larger
    portion (which might contain garbage).
    The function must call set_ui_visarea() to tell the core the portion of
    the bitmap which is actually visible (which might be smaller than
    requested), so the user interface can be drawn accordingly.
  - osd_update_video_and_audio() takes a bitmap parameter so must not be
    hardwired to draw Machine->scrbitmap.
  - New fields vector_width and vector_height in struct GameOptions. The OS
    dependant code must initialize them to force different resolutions for
    vector games. If left at 0, the default 640x480 is used.
  - osd_create_display() must no longer create the screen bitmap, this is done
    by the core. It must only create the display screen / window, and return 0
    on success.
    Note that the width and height parameters passed are now the dimensions of
    the visible area, not of the bitmap as they were before; therefore the
    function only has to create a screen / window of the requested size, without
    further processing, and without peeking into the drv->visible_area field.
    This applies to osd_set_display() as well.
  - Changed osd_new_bitmap() and renamed it osd_alloc_bitmap() to avoid
    confusion with old drivers. The function is the same as before but it must
    not swap width and height for vertical games - this is done by the core.
    osd_new_bitmap() and osd_free_bitmap() must not be called by drivers, they
    are reserved to the core. Drivers must call the equivalent bitmap_alloc()
    and bitmap_free() which take care of rotation for vertical games.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- The meaning of the full_refresh parameter to vh_screenrefresh() has been
  slightly extend. It usually means "don't make incremental updates to the
  screen bitmap, redraw it completely", however if the driver wants it can also
  mean "redraw all temporary bitmaps". This happens when using the functions
  below. This way, drivers doing lots of memset(dirtybuffer,1) can be
  simplified and schedule it just at the beginning of vh_screenrefresh.
- Added some functions that make flip screen handling a little more eloquent:
  flip_screen_x_w(), flip_screen_y_w(), flip_screen_w() to set the flip_screen
  bits, and 3 variables flip_screen_x, flip_screen_y, flip_screen to read them
  back. If the flipscreen changes, the funtions automatically set full_refresh
  to true for the next call of vh_screenrefresh.
  The functions also call tilemap_set_flip(ALL_TILEMAPS), so no further
  operations are required when using TileMaps.
  Finally, the functions also adjust the visible area, mirroring it, in case
  it is asymmetrical. For example, rockola.c relies on this.
- Also added 2 helper functions:
  - void set_vh_global_attribute( data_t *addr, data_t data )    This takes a
  pointer to any variable and a value, and sets the variable to the value.  In
  addition, if the value has changed, it sets full_refresh to true by calling
  the next function.
  - void schedule_full_refresh(void)   This just sets full_refresh to true for
  the next screenrefresh.  See vidhrdw/galaxian.c for examples on this and
  set_vh_global_attribute.

0.37 BETA 3

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed colors in Joyful Road. [Phil Stroffolino]


These drivers have improved SOUND:
----------------------------------

- Sound in Jumping. [Jarek Burczynski]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Lots of fixes to the 8080bw games. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Fixed dipswitches in many games. [Gerardo Oporto]

- Alternate control system in Assault, only available when cheats are enabled.
  [Maurizio Zanello]


Source:
-------

- Lots of changes to some CPU cores (mostly i86). I186 support. [Peter Trauner,
  Juergen Buchmueller, Aaron Giles]

- Preliminary MIPS CPU emulation. [smf]

- New makefile, easier to port, split into multiple files. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- New modes for drawgfx(): TRANSPARENCY_NONE_RAW, TRANSPARENCY_PEN_RAW,
  TRANSPARENCY_PENS_RAW, TRANSPARENCY_THROUGH_RAW. The purpose of these is to
  allow you to work in "raw" colorspace (that is, unremapped pens) and then
  perform the palette lookup at the end. This is useful for a number of games
  that do collision detection or foreground/background blends (e.g., the palette
  index is ((fgpen << 4) | bgpen)).
  When you use these modes, the "color" parameter doesn't refer to the palette
  any longer. Instead, it is just a value that is added to the raw pen value
  of the graphics you are drawing. That way, if your background layer uses
  pens 0-63 and your foreground layer uses pens 64-127, you can pass in a
  color of 0 when drawing the background layer and 64 when drawing the
  foreground.
  Also added copybitmap_remap() and copyscrollbitmap_remap(). These take the
  same parameters as the originals, but don't make the assumption that
  TRANSPARENCY_NONE means TRANSPARENCY_NONE_RAW (which, if you think about it,
  is the way they work).
  This means that you can do all your work with raw palette indexes until the
  very end, and then do a copybitmap_remap(TRANSPARENCY_NONE) to copy the
  result and do the remap step in the end.
  Finally, there's a new pair of modes that are only supported in
  copybitmap(): TRANSPARENCY_BLEND and TRANSPARENCY_BLEND_RAW. For these
  modes, the source bitmap is shifted left by the "color" parameter and then
  ORed into the destination bitmap. This lets you compute the palette indexes
  (and optionally do the lookup) for games that look up the palette by
  combining forground and background pen indices. [Aaron Giles]

- Moved logerror() from mame.c to the OS dependant code, and removed errorlog
  from the GameOptions structure.

- Major redesign of the artwork support. All the drivers need to do is call
  overlay_create() or overlay_load() and the rest is handled by the core.
  Opacity/translucency support in 16-bit mode.  Check out Space Invaders for
  example, the colored strips that make up the overlay is faintly visible
  under the black areas. [Mathis Rosenhauer, Zsolt Vasvari]

- Fixed YM2608 adpcm support. [Aaron Giles]

  [Brad Oliver]

- Extended the internal font to support characters 128-255 (ISO Latin-1).
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Fixed Hu6280 emulation bugs which caused missing levels in Trio the Punch.
  [Bryan McPhail]


Source:
-------

- Replaced instances of "if (errorlog) fprintf(errorlog," with a call to the
  new function logerror().

- New filetypes that must be supported by the OS dependant code:
  FILETYPE_HIGHSCORE_DB
  FILETYPE_HISTORY

  samples are still required). [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Completed sound in Splash. [Manuel Abadia]

- Samples support in Got-Ya. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Sound in Berlin Wall. [Luca Elia]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Support for 24-bit artwork. [Mathis Rosenhauer]


Source:
-------

- Support for a priority buffer, updated by tilemap.c, which can be used to
  draw sprites using the new function pdrawgfx(). This allowed to fix many
  tile/sprite priority bugs e.g. in Ajax, Lightning Thunder, Simpsons,
  Vendetta, Punk Shot, Gradius III and others.
  [Phil Stroffolino, Nicola Salmoria]

- Change the API for tilemap_mark_tile_dirty() and the get_tile_info hooks,
  now a single parameter tile_index is used instead of (col,row). A function
  passed to tilemap_create() does the (col,row)->tile_index mapping, two
  standard functions are provided for the common cases.
  All drivers have been converted to the new API except for namcos2.c, which
  is therefore broken at the moment. [Phil Stroffolino]

- New GAME_UNEMULATED_PROTECTION flag.

- 6803/63701 external port writes no longer set to 1 the bits that are set as
  inputs in the DDR register. Instead, they are set to the value returned by a
  read from the port. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Updated all memory handlers to the new READ_HANDLER()/WRITE_HANDLER() macro
  declarations. The old "function(int offset,int data)" style must not be used
  anymore.

  instead of truncating the least significant 8 bits. [Jarek Burczynski]

- [DOS] There are now two options for Hot Rod key mapping, -hotrod and
  -hotrodse. The latter remaps NeoGeo games to use the lower row of buttons.


Source:
-------

- There's a new game flag GAME_NO_COCKTAIL to mark drivers that don't support
  screen flip, please use it because gamelist.txt is now generated
  automatically and this is the only way to know whether a driver supports
  it or not.

==========================================================================

0.36 RELEASE CANDIDATE 1

A few drivers which didn't strictly fit MAME's purpose have been removed.
First of all there were a few drivers which, just like consoles or computers,
don't fall into the category of "arcade video games" that MAME attempts to
emulate. They should have never been added in the first place, and that mistake
is now being rectified.
One of the removed drivers is Street Fighter Zero for the CPS Changer, which
is not an arcade game even if it runs on arcade hardware. The source is left
in, commented out, because it could be useful as a reference for people
attempting to emulate CPS-2 (which, before you ask, won't happen anytime soon).
The so-called "home" versions of NeoGeo games have not ben removed because
there isn't anything in them suggesting that they are home-only games: they
accept coins just like all the others, and might just be different revisions
of the code.
Other removed drivers are four gambling machines. Note that a "gambling
machine" is different from a "video game with a gambling theme". The
discrimination is strictly a technical one, not a moral one (a gambling
machine gives back money/tokens/tickets, a video game does not).
The "Sente diagnostic cartridge" has not been removed because, even if it is
not a game, it is equivalent to the diagnostic tools that are built-in in many
other games - it's just that instead of pressing a service switch you had to
insert this special cartridge to test the board.
The last driver removed is Pong, which at this point was too much of a
simulation and too little of an emulation. It didn't really fit into MAME's
architecture which is CPU-based and targeted at accurately reproducing the
gameplay of the original.

That was a difficult decision to make, but thankfully I won't have to bother
about these things anymore in the future. Gotta go now! *waves*


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed sprites colors in Contra (I hope) and other improvements to Konami
  007121-based games. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed shadows in Gauntlet and other Atari games. [Aaron Giles]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Samples are no longer needed in Stratovox, Battle Zone, Red Baron, Asteroids.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Preliminary sound in Bandido. [Zsolt Vasvari, Juergen Buchmueller]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed controls in atarifb4 and atari soccer. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed protection in Super World Stadium '92. [Vernon C. Brooks]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] -hotrod selects a more appropriate button configuration when NeoGeo
  games are played. [Paolo Fiorani]

- The coin/start buttons are slightly changed. NOw they are layed out this way:
  1,2,3,4 -> start 1,2,3,4
  5,6,7,8 -> coin 1,2,3,4
  9,0,-,= -> service coin 1,2,3,4

- Preliminary support for HISCORE.DAT. [Phil Stroffolino]


Source:
-------

- 65sc02 and 65ce02 cpu cores. [Peter Trauner]

- [DOS] Compiled with Allegro WIP 3.9.31.

- Rewritten the Pokey emulator for greater accuracy. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Preliminary SN76477 emulation. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Fixed a rounding error in IPF_CENTER handling which caused problems with
  Centipede. Note, however, that it would be advisable to not use IPF_CENTER
  at all for trackball/dial inputs, since this is probably not how the
  hardware works in reality.
  For the same reason, also removed the "clip" parameter from the
  PORT_ANALOG() macro. Incidentally, this fixed Peek-a-Boo. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Lots of CPU fixes and cleanup. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Struct GfxLayout can now be parametric on the size of the memory region
  it refers to. This way the same gfx definition can be used for games with
  the same layout but different number of tiles. See drivers/m72.c,
  drivers/dec0.c for usage examples. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixes and improvements to the 6800 family emulator. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Improvements to the YM2151 emulator. [Jarek Burczynski]

- Only one of the two YM2151 emulators is linked, this is determined at compile
  time. The default is Jarek's, which is more accurate though a little slower.
  It can be replaced with Tatsuyuki's changing the makefile.

  title screen!). [Vernon C. Brooks]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Sound in Warp Warp. [juergen Buchmueller]

- [DOS] MMX optimized video blitting functions. [Bernd Wiebelt]


Source:
-------

- The transition to the GAME() macro is complete. struct GameDriver must no
  longer be used. Alro removed the old ROM_REGION() and ROM_REGION_DISPOSE()
  macros, and renamed ROM_REGIONX() to ROM_REGION().

- The functionality of osd_skip_this_frame() is now more strictly defined (see
  osdepend.h). Ports not complying with that must be updated, otherwise
  problems with certain drivers might arise.

- mixer.c now does all sound mixing, generating one single sample stream,
  played using the new osd_XXX_audio_stream() functions.
  All other OS dependant sample functions (osd_play_sample() etc.) have been
  removed. This should standardize the sound output across ports, and allow
  porters to write much cleaner sound code. [Aaron Giles]

- Removed some obsolete fields from struct GameOptions.

  osd_play_streamed_sample() and mixer_play_streamed_sample(): only the 16-bit
  version is available now.

- Added gain support to mixer.c, through the new MIXERG() macro (extension of
  MIXER()). Removed the gain filed from AY8910, YM2204, YM2610 structures.

- make68k.exe now requires as parameter the path of the comptab.asm include
  file (see makefile).

==========================================================================

0.36 BETA 14

Note: non volatile ram is now saved to a new directory, NVRAM (instead of
the old HI). You must create that directory manually, otherwise the files
will not be saved.


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Sprite multiplexing support in the Exidy440 games, this fixes Chiller's
  start screen. [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed the internal orientation of the Cinematronics games, if you use
  artwork files for those games you'll have tomanually flip them (or
  redownload).


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Improved Capcom Avengers, the wrong colors are caused by the protection.
  [Phil Stroffolino]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Added noise generator to the Namco sound emulation. [Takahiro Nogi]


Source:
-------

- Removed *rom_decode and *opcode_decode from struct GameDriver. Decryption
  must now be handled by *driver_init. If opcodes and data are decrypted
  separately, remember to allocate a larger chunk of memory in the ROM
  declaration, decode the opcodes there, and call memory_set_opcode_base()
  to tell the memory system where the opcodes are.
  Note that this new system allows bank switching with encrypted ROMs, which
  wasn't possible before. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Removed *hiscore_load and *hiscore_save from the GameDriver structure. To
  manage nvram/eeprom/cmos/etc the new *nvram_handler in struct MachineDriver
  must be used. High score save is temporarily disabled. It will be added
  again in a future release using an external .dat file. [Nicola Salmoria]

- The struct GameDriver reorganization is finally complete. Drivers should now
  use the GAME() and GAMEX() macros and not directly the GameDriver structure.
  IMPORTANT FOR PORTERS: Note that the clone_of field now is not necessarily
  0 even if the game is not a clone. If clone_of is not 0, to know if the game
  is a clone you have to check (clone_of->flags & NOT_A_DRIVER) is 0.

- Added OSD_FILETYPE_NVRAM.

- MachineDriver->frames_per_second is now a float.

Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed crash at the end of Gun Smoke level 3. [Paul Leaman]

- Fixed protection in Slam Masters. [Paul Leaman]

- Fixed protection in Devastators and Blades of Steel. [Manuel Abadia]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Alongside the AND key sequences introduced in the previous beta, it is now
  possible to have OR and NOT sequences.
  For recording OR key/joy sequences in the key/joy setup menu simply press
  UI_SELECT (usually ENTER) after the first recorded sequence. Don't press
  any UI_UP/UI_DOWN/UI_CANCEL keys beetwen the two sequences.
  To insert a NOT key/joy simply press it two times.
  The first obvious use for this is to wire button 1 to both the joystick and
  mouse button. [Andrea Mazzoleni]

==========================================================================

0.36 BETA 12

To all people that submitted high score save updates: high score save is on
hold. No additions will be made for the time being. In the near future, high
score support will be removed from the executable to an external file, much
like the cheat.dat one. We are looking for a volunteer to maintain that file.


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- 8039 in Finalizer. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed hanging music in Raiden. [Bryan McPhail]

- Fixed missing sounds in roishtar. [CAB]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Bypassed the protection in Exerion. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- The hangs in Tempest caused by the Pokey protection should now be fixed once
  and for all. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Fixed hangs in roishtar. [E. Watanabe, Takahiro Nogi]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Artwork files can be stored in a .zip file. That way you can have eg.
  both spacewr1.png and spacewr2.png in one file spacewar.zip.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Added the possibility to use a multiple keys or joysticks sequence to drive
  a generic action. This can be handy with consoles or cabinets with a limited
  number of buttons, to reuse all buttons with only one extra button, like a
  shift key. For example the COIN1 action can be mapped to the "Player 1 Fire"
  plus the "Extra Shift Button". It can also be used to map Q*Bert movements to
  joystick diagonals (since the orginal used a joystick rotate 45 degrees).
  [Andrea Mazzoleni]

- Added cpu overclocking control to the on screen display. [Juergen Buchmueller]


Source:
-------

- PORTERS BEWARE: the OS dependant code is now required to support a palettized
  16-bit display, where osd_modify_pen() can be called and the palette lookup
  is done during the final blit. A non palettized display can still optionally
  be used in special cases, see the comment about osd_allocate_colors() in
  osdepend.h. Also note that osd_allocate_colors() now can fail and returns a
  value; and the special case for 32768 pens has been removed, a valid palette
  is always passed to the function.

- Fixed OPN and OPM output level. Unfortunately this means that all games using
  YM2203, YM2151 etc. need to be rebalanced. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Removed memory_region from struct MachineCPU, now this information is stored
  directly in the ROM list using the REGION_CPUx attributes.
  Also remember that now you must never use Machine->memory_region[], always
  use memory_region() (and the same for memory_region_length).

Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed Bosconian score handling. [Vernon C. Brooks]

- Fixed Frisky Tom (note: delete friskyt.hi to fix coins). [Zsolt Vasvari]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Rewritten the sample listing routines for -listsamples, -listsamdir,
  -verifysamples and -listinfo. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- [DOS] New command -verifysets, this verifies all available games and reports
  their status (good/best available/bad). Also changed the format of the
  -verifyroms output. Some frontends might need small adjustments to parse
  the new output. [Bernd Wiebelt]

Important: due to changes in the palette system, there might be games that
had correct colors before, and wrong now. Please let us know if you find
any.


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed lots of drivers for -depth 16 support. [Zsolt Vasvari]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Fixed music in cworld2j [CAB]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed Go Go Mr. Yamaguchi [Takahiro Nogi]

- Fixed controls in Ikari III level 2. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed hangs in TNZS. [Quench]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Adjusted the autoframeskip code, to make it increase frameskip a little
  faster, but not as fast as it was before the previous change. Let's see how
  this performs. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Support for gzipped (NOT zipped) cheat files. Uncompressed files still work.
  [Mathis Rosenhauer]


Source:
-------

- Merged the flags and orientation fields of struct GameDriver.

- Removed prom_memory_region from struct GameDriver. The PROM memory region is
  now specified directly in the ROM declaration, with
  ROM_REGIONX( length, REGION_PROMS )
  Similarly, REGION_GFX1..8 are defined for gfx decoding, but drivers have not
  been updated to use them. See drivers/namcos86.c for the only example.

- Removed samplenames from stuct GameDriver. It is now in struct
  SamplesInterface, and some drivers load the samples directly without using
  that structure. Due to this change, -listsamples and -verifysamples, and the
  samples information in -listinfo, are no longer available. Actually, samples
  might not be working at all - I haven't tested them. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Removed base and size from struct MemoryReadAddress, use MemoryWriteAddress
  to store the pointers. Several drivers had the bad habit of using
  MemoryReadAddress to initialize those variables, hopefully I haven't broken
  any while updating them. [Nicola Salmoria]

-------------------------------------

- Fixed raster effects in Turf Masters (Japan course) and Zed Blade. Improved
  Super Sidekicks 2. [Massimo Morra]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixes to Lazer Command and Meadows Lanes. [Malcolm Lear]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- 16 bit support in the tilemap manager, so the Namco System 2 games no longer
  require -depth 8. [Phil Stroffolino]

- [DOS] Changed the -depth option behaviour, now it can be either 8, 16, or
  auto. The default is auto, which uses the color depth appropriate for the
  game. 8 forces use of a 256 colors display (faster but less accurate), 16
  forces use of a 16-bit display (not suggested, doesn't work with all games).
  MAKE SURE TO SET depth = auto IN MAME.CFG, OR YOU'LL USE 16-BIT IN ALL GAMES.

- Fixed a few bugs in the NEC CPU core that caused problems in Hook, Gunforce,
  Lethal Thunder and maybe others. [Bryan McPhail, Nao]

- Several changes and improvements to the TMS34010 emulation and to the
  Williams games using CVSD sound. [Aaron Giles]


Source:
-------

- [DOS] Now compiled with Allegro 3.9.27 WIP.

- Replaced MachineDriver->video_attributes VIDEO_SUPPORTS_16BIT with
  GameDriver->flags GAME_REQUIRES_16BIT.
  Added color_depth to struct RunningMachine and struct GameOptions. OS
  dependant code may set it to force a specific depth.
  Added depth parameter to osd_create_display(). The OS dependant code MUST
  respect it - if it has special requirements, it must set the GameOptions
  flag beforehand.

- Calling palette_recalc() is now *MANDATORY* in all drivers that modify the
  palette. The palette will not be updated otherwise.

- Removed adpcm_sample_list, palette and colortable from struct GameDriver.
  Changed char *color_prom to int prom_memory_region.

- Updated the TMS9900 emulator. [Raphael Nabet]

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed sprite lag in cps1, bionicc, lastduel. [Bryan McPhail]

- Fixed priorities in wndrmomo and genpeitd. [E. Watanabe]

- Sped up a little the NeoGeo raster effects. Enabled them in Karnov Revenge
  and Galaxy Fight. Fixed the field in ssideki3 etc. [Massimo Morra]

- Fixed sprite Y offset in the Simpsons dreamland level. Apologies for taking
  so long, I couldn't find the time to play it that far and hadn't realized I
  just had to use the attract mode of the Japanese version. [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- CVSD sound in Mouse Trap. [Dan Boris, Aaron Giles]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Changed the autoframeskip code, making it less anxious to increase
  frameskip as soon as speed drops below 100%. Let's see if this makes things
  better or worse. [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] The mouse buttons are no longer aliases for joystick buttons, they are
  independently recognized. They are still considered "joystick" inputs though,
  so if you want to use them you have to redefine the controls in the Joystick
  menu. This is a minor annoyance that was needed to allow interfacing a Discs
  of Tron controller to the mouse port (spinner + up and down switches) while
  still using joystick buttons 1 and 2 for fire and deflect. [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] Support for ZIPped input files (-playback) and artwork. Well, PNG won't
  compress very well, but I added it anyway ;) [Juergen Buchmueller]


Source:
-------

- Finally fixed the CMPX instruction in the 680x core. On the 6800 it does
  not affect the C flag, on the others (6803, 63701) it does.
  [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Fixes to the x86 asm 68k core. [Mike Coates]

- VIDEO_BUFFERS_SPRITERAM. See bionicc, darkseal, lastduel for usage examples.
  [Bryan McPhail]

- Added vh_eof_callback to the MachineDriver structure. See bionicc, cps1,
  lastduel for usage examples. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Cleaned up the 6809 and Konami-2 emulations. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- C140 emulation. [Phil Stroffolino]

Source:
-------

- [DOS] Now compiled with Allegro 3.9.26 WIP.

- Several improvements to FM sound emulators. This also fixes crashes in some
  Jaleco Mega System 1 games. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Improvements to the other YM2151 emulator too. [Jarek Burczynski]

- VIDEO_UPDATE_BEFORE_VBLANK is now the default. If you want your driver to
  redraw the screen after vblank, use VIDEO_UPDATE_AFTER_VBLANK.

- Rewritten the HC55516 CVSD decoder. This affects Sinistar, Joust 2, Arch
  Rivals, Pigskin, Tri-Sports, Smash TV, Trog, Narc. [Aaron Giles]

- Some improvements to the Z80 emulator. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Some fixes to HD63701 IRQ handling, and support for ICI (Input Capture
  Interrupt). [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Improvements to the 34010 emulation. [Aaron Giles]

- New function findmemorychunk() that lets you look up a chunk of memory and
  get its start/end addresses, and its base. This can be used (carefully!) by
  drivers that wish to access memory directly without going through the
  readmem/writemem accessors (e.g., blitters). [Aaron Giles]

- Replaced cpu_reset() with cpu_set_reset_line().
  cpu_set_reset_line(num,PULSE_LINE) is equivalent to the old cpu_reset().
  ASSERT_LINE resets the cpu and halts it. CLEAR_LINE restarts it.
  This avoids the need to call cpu_halt() in most cases. [Nicola Salmoria]

Source:
-------

  is instead a simple unsigned char *, pointing to a continuous stream of pixel
  data. The new line_modulo and char_modulo fields are helpers to find the
  offset in the array. [Nicola Salmoria]

0.36 BETA 2

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed sprites in Contra. [Phil Stroffolino]

- Accurate colors in Darwin 4078.

- Fixed sprite colors in Xybots. [Aaron Giles]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- 053260 emulation in Punk Shot. [Ernesto Corvi]

- Most System 16 games have sound. [Andrew Prime]

- Support for new samples in Q*Bert and Reactor. [Fabrice Frances]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Hacked protection in Wild Western, fixed bonus game, added second button
  to jump onto the train. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Sea Fighter Poseidon should be working now.

- Various fixes to System 16 games. [Andrew Prime]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Further improved the YM3812 emulator, especially the rhythm section (check
  Snow Bros!). [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- [DOS] -noym3812opl is now the default (this won't have effect unless you
  delete mame.cfg). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed a bug in the T-11 emulation which caused APB not to work and the end
  of race results in Super Sprint to contain garbage. [Aaron Giles]


Source:
-------

- Rewritten the OS dependant joystick interface, it's like the keyboard
  interface now. Also a few function renames, and osd_wait_keypress() must
  now return a keycode. [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] The above should remove all limitations on number of axis and buttons,
  so e.g. joypads with multiple sticks should work. Changes to the analog
  devices handling will follow. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Konami 052001/053248 CPU emulation, used by many games. [Ernesto Corvi,
  Manuel Abadia]

- Konami 053260 sound chip emulation. [Ernesto Corvi]

- Sega PCM and RFC68 sound emulators, used by System 16. [Hiromitsu Shioya]

- Moved the profiler into the core. The OS dependant code need only provide a
  osd_cycles() inline function/macro in osinline.h, returning a counter. The
  function must be as low overhead as possible since it is called thousands
  of times per second when the profiler is active. The counter should be as
  precise as possible, to provide accurate measurements; the ideal unit is the
  number of CPU cycles, e.g. as returned by the Pentium instruction RDTSC.
  The profiler display is handled by the core, so the OS code only has to make
  the usual profiler_mark() calls to profile different sections of the code
  (PROFILER_BLIT, PROFILER_SOUND and so on).
  Note: to avoid conflicts, the OS code must do the check for the "show fps"
  key this way, otherwise input will be lost:
	if (!keyboard_pressed(KEYCODE_LSHIFT) && !keyboard_pressed(KEYCODE_RSHIFT)
		&& !keyboard_pressed(KEYCODE_LCONTROL) && !keyboard_pressed(KEYCODE_RCONTROL)
		&& input_ui_pressed(IPT_UI_SHOW_FPS))
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] The -profiler switch is no longer needed to enable the profiler, it is
  automatically turned on and off when you hit Shift+F11. [Nicola Salmoria]

0.36 BETA 1

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed bad tiles in some CPS1 games. [Paul Leaman]

- Fixed sprite flipping in Xevious. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed title colors in Pinball Action. [Mirko Buffoni]

- Improved sprite colors in Great Swordman. [Jarek Parchanski, Charlie

  games. This fixes Bio Attack. Wild Western is now fully playable.
  [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Fixed Mega Zone high score display. [Chris Hardy]

- Fixed text colors in Legend of Kage. [Phil Stroffolino]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Major improvements to the System 16 driver, most games are working now. Many
  still lack sound though. [Andrew Prime]

- Fixed controls and graphics in Commando (Sega), which is now fully playable.
  This also fixes diagonal shots in Bosconian. Jungler shots are broken though.
  [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Fixed hanging sound in 4D Warriors. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Added "Get Ready!" speech to Grobda. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Fixed sound in Ninja Kid 2. [Jarek Parchanski]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- New digital YM3812/YM3526 emulator (in the DOS version, use -noym3812opl to
  enable it). It doesn't support the rhythm section yet, but is overall better
  than the old one. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- [DOS] Triple buffer support in tweaked VGA modes. Warning: this is slower
  than standard tweaked modes. [Brian Lewis]

- [DOS] If you are using a HotRod, use the -hotrod switch to adjust the default
  keyboard settings. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- [DOS] Compiled with Allegro WIP 3.9.23. IMPORTANT: there is a bug in
  Allegro's new keyboard hangling, which will prevent numeric pad keys from
  working properly when used together with ctrl and alt. Until it is fixed in
  the main Allegro distribution, you will have to replace the source file
  allegro\src\misc\pckeys.c with the provided one, and recompile Allegro.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] The new Allegro provides support for PSX and N64 pads (info here:
  http://www.debaser.force9.co.uk/ccmame), and for the Wingman Warrior.
  The names for the -joy parameter are
  psxlpt1
  psxlpt2
  psxlpt3
  n64lpt1
  n64lpt2
  n64lpt3
  wingwarrior
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Rewritten the OS dependant keyboard interface. A rewrite of the koystick
  interface will follow. The OS dependant code now only has to provide four
  functions:
  osd_get_key_list()
  osd_is_key_pressed()
  osd_customize_inputport_defaults() [optional]
  osd_wait_keypress() [optional]
  everything else is handled by the main core.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- New sprite manager, used in System 16, Ninja Gaiden, Shoot Out, Blood Bros.
  [Phil Stroffolino]

- Took the gfx drawing functions out of common.c into the new dragfx.c.
  In preparation for further changes to the data structures, abstracted the
  low level data copying and used macros to generate 8-bit and 16-bit
  versions. [Nicola Salmoria]

==========================================================================

0.35 RELEASE CANDIDATE 2

Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Added rotary control support to Top Gunner. This works in topgunbl *only* -
  the gun turret cannot be rotated in jackal and topgunr, those games don't
  support the rotary joystick. [Karl Stenerud]

- Incresed the horizontal resolution for NeoGeo to 320. This looks strange with
  some games, but it is definitely the correct value as I verified it on the
  real thing. Games like Puzzle Bobble and Baseball Stars use the extra area,
  while most of the other games draw just two bars in there. If a game looks
  odd, adjust your monitor to send the extra area offscreen. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed the slapstic emulation in Gauntlet, Gauntlet II, Xybots, Empire Strikes
  Back, Rampart. [Ernesto Corvi, Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed crashes in Demon, added analog controls to Tailgunner, fixed reset bug
  in Space Wars, added glove control to Boxing Bugs, added color to War of the
  Worlds and Boxing Bugs (seems to be wrong compared to Retrocade).
  [Mathis Rosenhauer]

- Added scroll to Pinball Action when you push button 4, but I'm not sure it's
  correct. [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Simplified the error message when ROMs are missing. It now gives a list of
  all the missing ROMs, it doesn't stop at the first one. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- IMPORTANT FOR PORTERS: the "safety area" allocated by osd_new_bitmap() must
  now be 16 pixels instead of 8. This is required by the NeoGeo driver.

==========================================================================

0.35 RELEASE CANDIDATE 1

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed background colors in Great Swordsman. [Jarek Parchanski]

- Fixed (hopefully) colors in Blue Print. [Nicola Salmoria]

Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Added dip switches to the Atari System 2 games. [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- The Pause key can be changed from the "Keys (defaults)" configuration menu.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added a palette viewer to the gfx viewer (F4). [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] New video modes from CabMAME: low scanrate modes for connection to
  NTSC/PAL and arcade monitors. -monitor NNNN selects the monitor type:
  "standard" (default), "ntsc", "pal", "arcade". -centerx N and -centery N
  each take a signed value (-8 to 8 for centerx, -16 to 16 for centery) and let
  you shift the low scanrate modes around. -waitinterlace forces update of
  both odd and even fields of an interlaced display for each game loop.
  [Brian Lewis]

- [DOS] Since there are now many tweaked VGA modes which may have compatibility
  problems with some video cards / monitors, they are now off by default. By
  default, VESA is used; the -vesa command line switch is no longer used.
  Instead, there is a -tweak switch which enables the VGA tweaked modes.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] New tweaked VGA modes: 384x240 (for CPS1, Pang etc.), 384x256 (for Lode
  Runner etc.), 336x240 (for Gauntlet and other Atari games), 320x240 (for
  NeoGeo and others). They are used automatically, if your video card/monitor
  can't handle them, use -notweak (or try adjusting the parameters in mame.cfg
  if you know what you are doing). [Brian Lewis, Andrea Mazzoleni]

- [DOS] Removed the -nodouble command line option. Use -nostretch instead. If
  you are updating from an earlier beta, make sure to delete mame.cfg (or
  manually update it) otherwise stretch will be disabled. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Changed the analog port handling to avoid problems with keyboard control
  (e.g. Arkanoid 2). [Nicola Salmoria]

Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Lots of improvements in the Atari drivers. [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed all known problems in Xain'd Sleena. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed decryption in Treasure Hunt [Zsolt Vasvari]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Enabled again the -triplebuffer option, and triple buffering is
  disabled by default. Remember that -triplebuffer disables -vsync, so if
  you absolutely want to use -vsync in VESA modes, don't use -triplebuffer.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improved VLM5030 emulation. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Fixed a couple of bugs in the 68000 emulation (both asm and C). They affected
  Power Spikes 2 and F1 Dream. [Mike Coates]

- Improved uPD7759 ADPCM decode. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- [DOS] -stretch 1024x768 can be used with Sichuan II and Golden Star.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Moved mixer control out of streams.c and into the new mixer.c. Now the On
  Screen Display can be used to change the volume of any channel, not just ones
  handled by streams.c. The configuration is also saved on exit and is
  automatically reloaded the next time you start the game. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- The zlib library is required to build MAME, it can be downloaded from
  http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/.

- PNG save support. save_screen_snapshot() may be called by osd_save_snapshot()
  to save a standardized shot. Under DOS, .png files go go to the SNAP
  directory. [Mathis Rosenhauer, Mike Haaland]

- struct GameSample no longer has a volume field (since it is not stored in .wav
  files), to replace that struct Samplesinterface has an additional volume field
  which affects all samples played. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Replaced osd_adjust_sample() with osd_set_sample_freq() and
  osd_set_sample_volume(), and the OSD_PAN_xxx macros with MIXER_PAN_xxx.

  screen when you insert a coin. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed Block Block title screen. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed the spider gfx, and sky color, in Rainbow Islands. [Mike Coates]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:

- Sound in Rainbow Islands. [Mike Coates]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Emulated the protection in Hippodrome, which is now working 100%.
  [Byan McPhail]

- Drastically reduced load times of the larger NeoGeo games. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Boss order in Super Real Darwin should be correct. [Jos Miguel Morales
  Farreras]

- Rainbow Islands is playable (using the C-Chip dump from Jumping).
  [Mike Coates]

- Memory card support in the NeoGeo driver. Card data is saved to the MEMCARD
  directory (you have to create it). Use the TAB menu to access the memory card
  options. [Fabrice Martinez]

- Fixed F1 Dream protection workaround (note that the game still doesn't work
  correctly with the 68000 C core). [Mike Coates]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] All flickering problems with triple buffering should now be solved, so
  it's now always ON. Let me know if you have problems with it, and I'll add
  back an option to disable it. vsync and waitvsync are automatically disabled,
  so you can leave them enabled - they will only be used in tweaked VGA modes
  or if your video card doesn't have enough RAM to do triple buffering.

- [DOS] Rough triple buffering support in VESA modes. You can turn it on with
  the -triplebuffer switch. It is not guaranteed to work well, but if it does,
  it offers results similar to -waitvsync but without the performance drop.
  Do NOT use it together with -vsync or -waitvsync. [Nicola Salmoria]

- A missing ROM for which no good dump is known to exist is no longer a fatal
  error - you can start the emulation even if the file is missing. Its space
  will be filled with random data. Of course the game will probably
  malfunction. The output of -verifyroms is slightly changed, it says "NO GOOD
  DUMP KNOWN" now and doesn't print 00000000 checksums. [Nicola Salmoria]

0.35 BETA 10

Please report any problem you find with the C 68000 core. There are no known
bugs as of now (apart from ball movement in Power Spikes 2), if no new bugs
are found we'll switch back to test the asm core.


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed colors in Birdie King 2. [Zsolt Vasvari]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- "kbmame" multi-button key equivalents for the NeoGeo games. They are only
  available if cheats are enabled. [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Added menu option to configure the default joystick settings (like the
  default keys), [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] Fixed severe slowdowns when 16-bit audio was selected.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] The parameters which control tweaked VGA modes can be changed by
  editing mame.cfg, so they can be fine tuned to match each particular video
  card/monitor combination (these are non standard modes so they can't be made
  to work in the same way on all setups). If you want to try that (warning:
  only experienced users should try) make sure to read vgatweak.txt.
  [Valerio Verrando]

- Changed format of the history database. [John Butler]


Source:
-------

- Reorganized the sound subsystems, hopefully I didn't break anything in the
  process. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added support for up to 4 analog controllers (multiple trackballs are NOT
  supported under DOS, but multiple joysticks should work). [Brad Oliver]


New games supported
-------------------
Shooting Master (not working due to protection) [Nicola Salmoria]
Senjyo [Mirko Buffoni]
Star Cruiser (preliminary) [Frank Palazzolo]
RodLand (Japan) [Luca Elia]
Earth Defense Force [Luca Elia]
Avenging Spirit [Luca Elia]
Disco No.1 [Zsolt Vasvari]

New clones supported
--------------------
Star Force (encrypted) [Nicola Salmoria]


==========================================================================

0.35 BETA 9

After the problems with the last few betas, this should be a stable release
again. All games which worked before the core changes should be working again.
Let us know if you find some still broken.


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed background in Pig Newton. [Mike Balfour]

- Fixed the Galaxian-style starfield. Believe it or not, it had been broken
  since day 1. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Converted the System 16 drivers to use the TileMap system - they are now
  cleaner, faster, and support screen rotation. [Phil Stroffolino]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed hangs in Super Real Darwin when big bosses come, however the order
  they appear in is likely wrong (it's a protection issue). If you know the
  correct order, contact mish@tendril.force9.net. [Bryan McPhail]

- Emulated the protection in Jump Bug (Rock-ola). Some ROM splitup too, and
  fixed colors. [Zsolt Vasvari]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] New tweaked 256x256 VGA modes (both scanlines and noscanlines)
  stretched to fill the screen. They are automatically used for horizontal
  games, and are preferable to the -stretch option since they are faster.
  You might have to adjust your monitor settings to make them properly
  centered and fill the screen (use the border displayed on startup as a
  guideline). [Valerio Verrando]


Source:
-------

- The debugger is almost complete. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Redesigned the struct InputPort to use less space, and changed how analog
  inputs are defined. An additional benefit is that the keys for digital
  emulation of analog inputs are now defined in the Keys for this Game menu,
  together with all other keys, instead that in the Analog Controls menu.
  The Analog Controls menu remains to set the other parameters.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added default strings for dip switches. For example, instead of "Cabinet",
  use DEF_STR( Cabinet ). The constants are defined in inptport.h.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

-------------------
Sindbad Mystery [Nicola Salmoria, Mike Balfour]
Yamato (preliminary) [Nicola Salmoria]

==========================================================================

0.35 BETA 8

Most of the problems of beta 7 have been fixed, but the C 68000 core still
isn't 100%.


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed missing item at the bottom of the screen in Tower of Druaga.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed again the colors in Lode Runner 2. This time it should really be 100%.
  [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Implemented the RC filters in early Konami games (Time Pilot, Pooyan, etc.)
  [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Added voices to Rolling Thunder. [Ernesto Corvi]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed 1 player start button not working on level 31 of Tower of Druaga.
  [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Added a "Game History" entry to the menu. Data is fetched from the file
  HISTORY.DAT. Thanks to Brian Deuel, Neil Bradley and the Retrocade dev team
  for allowing us to use Retrocade's game history database. [John Butler]

- All new, completely rewritten debugger (not finished yet). [Juergen
  Buchmueller]

- [DOS] Switches -noartwork and -nosamples to turn off artwork or sample
  loading. [Valerio Verrando]


New games supported
-------------------
TNK3 [Carlos A. Lozano, Phil Stroffolino]
ASO [Carlos A. Lozano, Phil Stroffolino]

King and Balloon (Japan) [Yasuhiro Ogawa]
Aero Fighters (Turbo Force hardware) [Nicola Salmoria]


==========================================================================

0.35 BETA 7

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Added the missing background layer to Cobra Command. [Bryan McPhail]

- Colors & sprites in Super Real Darwin should be correct. [Bryan McPhail]

- Char/sprite priority in Lode Runner 2 & 3 and in Battle Road. [Eric Hustvedt]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed the in game timer in Captain Silver, this probably fixes other
  gameplay glitches. [Bryan McPhail]

- Fixed controls in Gondomania and Last Mission. [Bryan McPhail]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- new switch "-waitvsync /-nowaitvsync" (use it with -novsync); it waits for
  video sync before drawing the screen but uses the normal MAME throttling.
  This gives smoother display with scrolling game (like vsync), but works
  with video modes with higher refresh frequency, and is more win-friendly.
  [Valerio Verrando]


Source:
-------

- Major overhaul to the cpu cores. Note that the debugger doesn't work in this
  release. [Juergen Buchmueller]


New games supported
-------------------
The Battle-Road [Eric Hustvedt]

New clones supported
--------------------
Block Block (bootleg) [Nicola Salmoria]
TNZS (bootleg) [Nicola Salmoria]


==========================================================================

0.35 BETA 6

Note: the CPU cores have been completely torn apart and rearranged in this
release. Don't be surprised if a large number of games don't work at all.
FOr example, Twin Cobra doesn't boot, and most (all?) of the games using
a 6803 lock up (ctrl-alt-del needed).


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed colors in Lode Runner 2. Also fixed the layout of round 8 and 28.
  [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] New -stretch option to optionally stretch low resolution games to fill
  the screen. The default is -stretch off, which is the same behaviour as
  before. -stretch 1024x768 automatically uses the "quadra" mode for horizontal
  games whose resolution is less or equal to 256x256. -stretch 800x600 uses
  the "triple" mode. The -quadra and -triple options are no longer needed and
  have been removed.
  1024x768 will be perfect (for 256x256 games) or almost perfect (for 256x240
  and 256x224 games) without monitor adjustment, so it is indicated for LCD
  displays. However, it is slower than 800x600. 800x600 is faster but the games
  are stretched to resolutions from 768x448 to 768x512, so they don't fill the
  screen and are squashed vertically. Here's the tip: if your monitor is good
  enough, you can use the controls to expand the picture and make it fit
  perfectly in the screen. Note that this tip  applies not only to stretched
  modes, but also to med-res games like Lode Runner (384x256) and the CPS1
  games (384x224). The CPS1 games in particular are unbearably squashed unless
  you adjust the monitor. [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] New option -volume n to set the startup volume. The volume is an
  attenuation in dB, e. g. "-volume -12" will start with a -12dB attenuation.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- The user interface is rotated by -rol and -ror. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improvements to the YM2610 timers, added an interface for external volume
  control. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Major changes to the whole CPU interface and cores. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- [DOS] All new, completely rewritten autoframeskip code. [Nicola Salmoria]

==========================================================================

0.35 BETA 5

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Kludged in a fix for char/sprite priority in Traverse USA. [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Sound in Pac-Land, and improved Rolling Thunder. [Ernesto Corvi]

- Full sound in Sly Spy, Midnight Resistance, Dark Seal. [Bryan McPhail]

- Emulated the death sound in Mario Bros, the sample is no longer used.
  [Brian Stern]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

- DEC8 games. [Roberto Fresca]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Emulated the protection in Sly Spy. [Bryan McPhail]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Added a header to .inp files (same as MAME32). With the additional
  header, the user no longer needs to specify the game name when playing back
  .inp recordings. [Mike Haaland]

- Added the ability to show the total number of colors on screen. This is
  useful during development to know if a game can be shrinked to 256 colors or
  it requires a 16-bit display. Press CTRL+F11 to toggle the display. This is
  only available in debug builds. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- The TileMap code is now mature enough to be used in new drivers. For
  examples, look into gng, gaiden, travrusa. [Phil Stroffolino]

- Merged the old and new Namco sound subssytem, and added support for stereo
  output. [Aaron Giles]

- H6280 emulator, used by several DECO games. [Bryan McPhail]

==========================================================================

0.35 BETA 4

Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- It seems that the Fatal Fury 2 protection was still causing some problems in
  later levels. It should now be completely worked around. NOTE: YOU MUST
  DELETE FATFURY2.HI OR THE GAME WILL MALFUNCTION AFTER THE FIRST BONUS ROUND.
  [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] New -quadra and -triple video options. They are slower than the
  others, but provide interesting features. With -quadra the screen is
  quadrupled horizontally and tripled vertically, so a 256x256 game fits
  perfectly in a 1024x768 screen. -triple triples horizontally and doubles
  vertically, so it's perfect for Moon Patrol. [ole00@usa.net]

- Improved palette compression with color fades. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improved the YM2610 emulation. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]


Source:
-------

- [DOS] Now compiled using Allegro 3.11. Unfortunately, contrary to what I
  had been promised, allegro.h provided with the library still fails to
  compile with MAME, so a fixed one is included.

  were particularly affected by reduction to 256 colors. [Nicola Salmoria]

- CPS1 games are being worked on, they are temporarily slower but accuracy is
  improved.

- Improved Star Fire. [Olivier Galibert]

Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Support for the ORIGINAL version of Bubble Bobble, with 68705 code from a
  pirate board. Wizards *do* throw stones in this version. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Removed the protection in Fatal Fury 2. [Eugenio De Renzi]

- Emulated the protection (TMS32010) in Twin Cobra, which is now fully
  playable. [Quench]

- Fixed the protection in Frisky Tom. [Andrew Prime]

- Properly emulated the 68705 protection in The Electric Yo-Yo, Kram, Space
  Dungeon, Zoo Keeper. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Simulated the 8751 protection in F1 Dream, but it seems to work on Macs
  only (endian issue?). [Eric Hustvedt]

- Improved Birdie King 2 which is now playable. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Fixed speed in Oscar. [Bryan McPhail]

- Super Real Darwin is fully working. [Bryan McPhail]


Source:
-------

- A couple of bug fixes in the 6808 core. [Brad Oliver]

- TMS32010 emulator. This is used by Twin Cobra. [Quench]

- New experimental TileMap code, used by Ninja Gaiden and Ghosts and Goblins.
  This makes the driver code cleaner and gives a major performance boost in

==========================================================================

0.35 BETA 2

Note: the CPU cores are still in a state of flux. Most of the problems in 35b1
have been fixed, however some still remain (e.g. Gauntlet doesn't accept
coins and Exterminator crashes).

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed the sprite/playfield and playfield/playfield priorities in Bad Dudes /
  Dragon Ninja and Sly Spy. [Bryan McPhail]

- Fixed the title screen in P.O.W. [Bryan McPhail]

- Fixed gaps in the start/finish line in Neo Drift Out. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Attempt at emulating some raster effects in the NeoGeo games. The IRQ2
  handling is still 99% unknown, however you can see the field in Super
  Sidekicks 3 and 4. This is largely unaccurate, and VERY slow. Hit F1 to
  toggle the emulation on or off (by default it's on). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Almost accurate colors in Galivan. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improved row scrolling in Street Fighter 2, plus several other fixes to the
  CPS1 games. [Paul Leaman]

- Fixed sprite colors in Euro League. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed sprites disappearing abruptly in TMNT end of game credits. [Nicola
  Salmoria]

- Fixed the green and white flags in Championship Sprint / Super Sprint, and
  maybe other Atari System 2 sprites as well. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed sprite flipping in Jack the Giant Killer end sequence. [Brad Oliver]

- Fixed (?) the title in Galaxian Part X. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Accurate colors in Mariner. [Gerald Vanderick]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Added support for the 7751 sound chip in Monster Bash. Two samples are still
  needed (discrete circuits). [Mike Balfour]

- Good progress in sound emulation of the Exidy games (Venture, Pepper 2, etc.)
  [Dan Boris]

- Fixed the YM2203 in Ghost Busters. [Bryan McPhail]

- Speech in TMNT. Sound should now be 100% complete. [Howie Cohen]

- uPD7759 support in Golden Axe, Shinobi, Passshtb, Alien Syndrome,
  Altered Beast. [Howie Cohen]

- Emulated speech in Sinistar. Samples are no longer used. [Alex Pasadyn]

- Sound in The Main Event. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Sound fade timer ports in the CPS1 games (see Willow's Test mode for an
  example). [Paul Leaman]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

- Side Pocket, Rolling Thunder. [Dave W.]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Emulated the protection in Seicross, Radical Radial, Frisky Tom. However
  Frisky Tom is still not playable (hangs when you fall). [Nicola Salmoria]

- The hang in Tapper should REALLY be fixed this time. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Emulated the protection in Knights of the Round and Carrier Air Wing.
  [Paul Leaman]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] The key to change frameskip is now F9 instead of F8. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- New 68000 C core. For testing purposes, this is also being used in the DOS
  version instead of the asm core. [Karl Stenerud]
  Differences:

  1. Faster.  This code is, barring ram fetch time, almost twice as fast as the
     existing C core in MAME.  I've done extensive speed profiling on both
     engines.  The only problem now is the slow memory access in MAME due to
     bankswitching et al.

  2. Emulation more correct.  I found many bugs in the MAME engine (and many,
     many more in mine for that matter) when I pitted them head-to-head.
     I have run random instructions from each opcode class at least 10 million
     times, comparing the resultant CPU states, and have left it running random
     instructions for 1 billion iterations.  In every case, I have adhered to
     the specs defined in M68000PM/AD REV. 1.

  3. Disassembler is correct.  The current M68000 disassembler in mame has a
     tendency to disassemble instructions that have an invalid EA mode.

  4. Cycle counting is 99.9% correct.  The only instructions which don't have
     correct cycle counts are divs, divu, muls, mulu, and they're not worth
     counting correctly. (I'm not about to waste emulation time counting 0-1 and
     1-0 sequences).

  5. > 32 bit friendly.  I've taken care to ensure maximum portability without
     sacrificing speed.  The result is conditional compiling dependant on your
     architecture.  I've also implemented and tested a compatible solution for
     architectures that lack 8, 16, or 32 bit signed storage types.

  6. The code is carefully laid out to be readable. (I beg to differ - NS)

- Fixed some bugs in the I8039 emulation. [Brian Stern]

- Z8000 emulator. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- NEC uPD7759 emulation. This is used by TMNT, System 16, and others.
  [Juergen Buchmueller, Mike Balfour, Howie Cohen]

- CVSD emulation, used for speech in Sinistar and in the 34010 games (Smash TV
  etc.). [Larry Bank, Alex Pasadyn]

==========================================================================

0.35 BETA 1

Note: the configuration save format has changed. You may just as well delete
all of the cfg/*.cfg files, since they won't be loaded. Old .inp files will not
work either.
The good news is that the default key assignments can now be modified, so you
don't have to change them for all the games. The code is a quick hack put
together in fifteen minutes, but it's bettern than nothing. It will be improved
in future versions.


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed Psychic 5 and Toki title screens. [Jarek Parchanski]

- Proper support of the playfiled/sprite priority and palette system in Return
  of the Jedi. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Accurate colors in Spelunker II. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed Heiankyo Alien colors. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Fixed NeoGeo palette - it's 5 bits per gun, not 4. Of course this makes the
  reduction to 256 colors even more difficult. 16-bit video modes will be
  supported in a later version. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added a kludge to avoid leftover sprites in Rally-X. [Larry Bank]

- Fixed missing background behind the three towers in Metal Slug level 1.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed missing line in the tank's shot in Metal Slug intro. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed the Swimmer side panel background color. [Gary Walton]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Fixed shoot sound in Juno First. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added PCM samples to Ninja Kid II. [Jarek Parchanski]

- Added the 007232 to TMNT. Another sound chip is still missing to get 100%
  sound. [Howie Cohen]

- Sound in Psycho-Nics Oscar. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Partial sound in The Real Ghostbusters. The YM203 doesn't seem to work
  correctly. [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

- Road Fighter, Iron Horse. [Howie Cohen]

- Lizard Wizard. [M.C. Silvius]

- Space Tactics. [Zsolt Vasvari]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Analog joystick support in Sinistar and Blaster. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Worked out the Super Punch Out protection. [Tatsuyuki Satoh, Ernesto Corvi]

- Hacked the protection in Super Sidekicks. [Battlepriest]

- Fixed two players games in Phoenix, and the protection in Pleiads (which
  made game resets not work). [Zsolt Vasvari]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Support for the Namco System 1 sound system. [Ernesto Corvi]

- [DOS] Widened the frameskip range. It now is 0-11, meaning the number of
  frames to skip out of 12. For example, if the game normally runs at 60 fps,
  "-frameskip 2" will make it run at 50 fps, and "-frameskip 6" at 30 fps.
  Also, if a frame takes more than the allotted time to display, the lost
  time can be recovered in the following frames. Moreover, improved the way
  audio streams are handled, so they stay more in sync with the video. There
  should never be any more audio breakups EVER (as long as your system can
  keep the game running at 100% speed).
  All of these changes together mean that it is now possible to run at much
  higher frame rates than before (if your system is fast enough).
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] Implemented auto frameskip. It dynamically adjusts the frameskip
  setting to display the maximum possible frames without dropping below 100%
  speed.
  It is on by default; to turn it off, specify an explicit frameskip value,
  e.g. "-frameskip 0". Autoframeskip only works well if your machine is fast
  enough to run the game at 100% speed. If it isn't, you had better use a
  fixed frameskip.
  NOTE: you must delete mame.cfg (or manually change the line "frameskip = 0"
  to "frameskip = auto") for the auto frameskip to become the default.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] "vmame" modes 320x480 and 400x600, which speed up scanlined VESA modes
  for some games and graphic cards which support these resolutions.
  Currently, these modes will not be autodetected, that is, the commandline
  options "-320x480" or "-400x600" have to be used.
  [Nicola Salmoria, Michael Cunanan]

- [DOS] Joysticks are now selected by a symbolic name (e.g. "-joystick wingex"
  for Wingman Extreme) instead of a number. For the list of names, look into
  readme.txt. Numbers are still supported, but may not be in future releases.
  SNES gamepads on parallel ports are supported now, provided you have some
  additional hardware (the "official" Snespad-Support site is
  http://snespad.emulationworld.com). [Bernd Wiebelt]

- [DOS] For cosmetical reasons, added support for VESA3, which can be selected
  by putting "vesamode=vesa3" into mame.cfg. It is highly unlikely that you'll
  get any speed improvement. [Bernd Wiebelt]


Source:
-------

- New function cpu_getcurrentframe() which returns the number of the video
  frame currently being played. It can be used by drivers to control effects
  which spawn over multiple frames (e.g. blinking) without using static
  internal counter (which would require a custom interrupt handler to avoid
  problems when the game is paused). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Frame skipping is entirely handled by the OS dependant code.
  osd_skip_this_frame() no longer has the "recommend" parameter.
  Also, replaced osd_update_display() and osd_update_audio() with the single
  osd_update_video_and_audio().
  IMPORTANT: osd_update_video_and_audio() is called *every frame* by the main
  core. It's its responsability to know whether the frame has to be skipped.
  osd_skip_this_frame() is used by the main core only to know if it can avoid
  calling drv->vh_update(). [Nicola Salmoria]

- New Z80 emulator. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Fixed several bugs in the I86 emulator. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- New CPU interrupt system. The functions cpu_set_irq_line() and
  cpu_set_nmi_line() can be used to precisely control the status of the CPU
  physical lines, instead of using the limited control granted by
  cpu_cause_interrupt(). [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Konami 007232 sound chip emulator. This is used by TMNT. [Hiromitsu Shioya]

- The driver input ports are now 16 bit. This allows for higher resolution
  analog inputs (Arkanoid 2). Also, the 68000 based games no longer have to
  read and mix two 8 bit ports to get a 16 bit value. [Brad Oliver]

- [DOS] Now compiled with Allegro 3.1. Unfortunately the standard allegro.h
  doesn't compile with the pedantic compiler setup we are using, you'll have to
  use the provided fixed version instead. [Bernd Wiebelt]

- Added a horrible dirty hack to allow opcode encryption on CPUs other than
  the main one. It's really ugly and needs a rewrite, but it's enough to get
  sound in Pocket Gal and The Real Ghostbusters. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Exported info_cpu_name(), info_sound_name() and other similar functions from
  info.c so they can be used by usrintf.c and by anyone else who needs them.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

-----------------------------------------------
Space Panic (German) [Mike Coates]
Cook Race (this was previously called hamburge) [Nicola Salmoria]


==========================================================================

0.34 BETA 8

Neo Geo status
--------------

- All games work, both in arcade and home mode. If you are stuck with a
  copyright message or the coin inputs don't work, delete the .CFG and .HI file
  for that game. This will fix the problem.
  Super Sidekicks 2 controls still stop working after a couple of minutes,
  though. Crossed Swords doesn't let you start a game in arcade mode. It works
  in home mode.

- Sound support is 95% complete. If you experience garbled sound and you get
  NO GOOD DUMP EXISTS errors, this is caused by bad ROMs, not by imperfect
  emulation. There is NO WAY to fix that apart from redumping the bad ROMs.

- If you get a Z80 ERROR message, it means that the sound program ROM is bad.
  Run the game without sound.

- A few games have graphics glitches which are not easily fixed.

- "ROM length mismatch" errors. If you get these, you are just using ROMs
  larger than the ones MAME expects. This is not a fatal error and the game
  will still run fine (provided the ROMs are good, of course). You can "fix"
  the ROMs yourself just by removing the second half of the file.
  Note that the sizes used by MAME are sort of arbitrary. In many cases it is
  difficult to know for sure which size the ROMs are really supposed to be, so
  we decided to consistently use the smallest possible files. The real ROMs
  *might* be larger than that, but the extra space is not used by the game -
  it is either all FF, or contains a verbatim copy of the first half.


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Better colors in Scion (still not accurate) [Dick Millikan]

- Added artwork support to Lunar Lander. [Cristopher Kirmse]

- Added artwork support to Asteroid Deluxe. [Peter Hirschberg, Mathis Rosenhauer]

- Background light support in Discs of Tron. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Improved the Pokey emulation. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Support for stereo output. This is implelemented in the YM2610 and in
  Tatsuyuki's YM2151. It can be used by other games, for example the Atari
  System 2 games (Paper Boy etc.) have two Pokeys, one per channel.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed bass track in Do Run Run. [Jim Hernandez]

- Partial sound in Satan of Saturn. [Nicola Salmoria]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Chelnov is now playable! Plus many other fixes to the driver including
  slowdowns in Karnov. [Bryan McPhail]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Stereo sound support. It is a little slower than mono, to turn it off
  use -nostereo. Stereo is enabled only for YM2610 and YM2151 games. The others
  always use mono.

- [DOS] New -listinfo command to give details on all of the supported games.
  [Andrea Mazzoleni]

- Several changes to the cheat system, you'll have to download a new cheat
  database if you want to use it. [JCK]

- [DOS] Now using a new beta version of the SEAL audio library which further
  improves the dynamic range. You'll notice louder and better balanced sound
  in many games. Let me know about games with bad balance. [Nicola Salmoria]

0.34 BETA 6

Note about the x86 asm 68000 core: several bugs have been fixed (most notably,
it now runs under pure DOS) but it is still not complete. For example, the two
Metal Slugs hang shortly after game start. They will work if you recompile
using the C core.


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Accurate colors in Jungler. Also fixed char flipping and sprite alignment.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improved Vastar. [Roberto Ventura]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Sound in Super Space Invaders. [Ernesto Corvi]

- Added decay to Donkey Kong. [Andrew Scott]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Replaced the -fm option with -ym2203opl. Added -noym3812opl to use the
  digital emulation of the YM3812 instead of the SoundBlaster OPL chip. Note
  that with -noym3812opl you also need external drum samples. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Clone sets are not reported as missing by -verifyroms if only the parent set
  is present. [John Butler]


Source:
-------

- [DOS] Now using version 1.05 of the SEAL audio library. This should fix
  problems with the ENSONIQ AudioPCI and Creative PCI64 cards.

- YM2610 emulator. This is used by the NeoGeo games. [Hiromitsu Shioya]

- TMS9900 emulator. [Andy Jones, based on original code by Ton Brouwer]


NeoGeo Support
--------------

This beta contains some major improvements to the neogeo emulation.  Work on
this driver also uncovered several bad rom dumps, most of which you can correct
yourself, existing bad rom dumps should still work but will give checksum and/or
rom length errors on startup.

How to:

You need a zip file called neogeo.zip in your rompath.  It should contain at
least three files:

neo-geo.rom (128k)
ng-sfix.rom (128k)
ng-sm1.rom (128k)

The rom 'ng-sm1.rom' is badly dumped in many archives, you will need one that is
128k, see later for full details on bad roms.  Using a 256k rom will still work
but will give a length & checksum error on every game.

Important!  The bios zip file must be called neogeo.zip NOT neo-geo.zip, ie,
there should be no dash in the middle.

You also need to place the game zip in your rompath.  If you do not know what 8
character filename the NeoGeo game you want to play has you can type:

mame -listclones neogeo

That will list the 8 character zip names of all currently supported games.

What's New?
-----------

* FULL sound support, FM synth and ADPCM samples, on 90% of games using the
YM2610 emulator.  The games without working sound should be fixed soon.

- Optional rom loading of samples:  You may find games that worked before will
not work now due to lack of memory as all the sound roms need to be loaded.
Some games will require an extra 16 megabytes of memory to load the sound roms.
You can force Mame NOT to load these samples if you specify no sound BEFORE rom
loading takes place.  In Dos this means you must type:

mame game -soundcard 0

If you DO NOT specify soundcard 0 then all sound roms will be loaded and you may
experience memory problems.

* Improved graphics:

- Auto-animations are supported, these are used in many games.  The Neogeo
graphics hardware can cause animation without intervention from the main cpu.
You can see this in the backgrounds of games such as Karnov's Revenge, Street
Hoops, Samurai Shodown, King Of Fighters, etc.

- Very accurate scaling support, including full screen zooms.

- No more 'missing tiles' on zoomed graphics.

- MAJOR speedup!  You should see at least 20-50% increase on all games.  The downside is
you will see a black screen for a few seconds at the start of every game as
the graphics are converted to a custom format.  There are many other
optimisations in the video code too.

- Fixed bug in y-flipped tiles glitched when y<0 (Thrash Rally)

* All games for which rom dumps are available are now supported.  99% of them
are working.

* Several games have experimental 68000 idle cycle skipping, for these games you
should see increases of between 5% and 20%.  Games currently using this method
are:
	Puzzle De Pon
	Karnov's Revenge
	Wind Jammers
	Street Hoops
	Neo Bomberman

* SRAM save size has been reduced to 0x2000 bytes from 0x10000.  The NeoGeo
has 8 memory frames and will store sram data for upto 8 games regardless
of how many physical cartridges the machine can take.  The Mame emulation
emulates a fixed 1 cartridge neogeo, therefore only the first 0x2000
bytes of the SRAM should ever be used.  Due to bullet-proofed(!) memory
handling there should be no more corrupt sram saves either.  Remember you can
delete a game settings by deleting it's file in the 'hi' directory.

Bug where SRAM states were reloaded upon every reset is fixed.

Known Problems/To Do:
---------------------

Some games will give a piracy warning.  You can still play the games if you
set them to run in Console (Home) mode.  For some games you can set the game
back to arcade mode after the protection check is done and leave it that
way (because some games leave a flag in SRAM as to whether the game has passed
it's security check).

Line (row) scrolling is not implemented.  This is used for the floor in
Karnov's Revenge, special effects in Spinmasters, etc, and many others.

The calendar chip is not yet implemented.

This release should give a substantial speed boost over previous betas, and there
are some more optimisation ideas to be tried.

Bad Roms
--------

Several bad rom dumps have been found, this is where a rom has corrupt data
and may also be the wrong size.  'Fixed' rom dumps will become available from
the usual places in time.  The most common error is that a rom is twice the
size it should be, and that the second half is either the same as the first or
just has junk in it.  To be fix these roms you simply split them in half, and
throw away the second half.  You should do a binary split, meaning your split
program should not save any formatting information to the file.  As mentioned
above bad rom dumps will continue to work but will give checkums and length
errors.

The Neorage team will support all fixes to the bad roms and make sure their
emulator is compatible.  Most fixed romsets will work on Neorage already.

0.34 BETA 5

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Fixed sprite flipping in Super Qix. [Mirko Buffoni]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Partial sound in Punk Shot. [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

- Champion Baseball. [Howie Cohen]

- Quantum. [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Improved the user interface. Use "the key on the left of 1" (tilde on some
  leyboards) to turn on the On Screen Display which lets you change Volume,
  Gamma Correction, Brightess, and independently set the volume levels of the
  sound chips. Tab still brings up the setup menu, which is now asynchronous.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] Improved the profiler. It now REQUIRES the Pentium-class RDTSC
  instruction. It will not work on 486s, older Pentiums, and maybe other
  non-Intel CPUs. [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- x86 ASM 68000 core. This is a major speed improvement. [Mike Coates, Darren
  Olafson]

- YM3812 and YM3526 software emulator. In the DOS version it is disabled
  because we are using the 100% compatible SoundBlaster OPL chip.
  [Carl-Henrik Skrstedt]

- A begginning for a YM2413 emulator. It pushes data through the YM3812.
  [Paul Leaman, Ernesto Corvi]

- I86 disassembler for the debugger, based on code by Robin Hilliard.
  [Andrea Mazzoleni]

- New functions install_mem_read_handler() and install_mem_write_handler().
  They can be used to install special memory handlers (for example, to trap
  busy loops, or to make small changes to the memory map for games running
  on similar hardware). [Alex Pasadyn]

- New field driver_init in the GameDriver structure. It's an optional function
  which can be used to do some game specific initialization, for example by
  adding memory handlers using the above functions. [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the cheat system [JCK]

New in MAME 034b4 :
 * Possibility of "circular" values in search method 1:
 - if you press OSD_KEY_LEFT or OSD_KEY_DOWN when value is 0, it turns to
0xFF
 - if you press OSD_KEY_RIGHT or OSD_KEY_UP when value is 0xFF, it turns to
0.
 * Added the possibility of toggling the watches display ON (Insert) and OFF
(Del) .
 * Possibility to work on another cheat file (CHEAT.DAT is just the default
one) by using option "-cheatfile xx"
 * Added new types of cheats:

==========================================================================

0.34 BETA 4

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Pleiads colors might be correct now. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Accurate colors in Strategy X. [Gerald Vanderick]

- Preliminary backdrop support in Discs of Tron. The background image must be
  called ARTWORK/DOTRON.PNG. [Mathis Rosenhauer, Brandon Kirkpatrick]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Fixed sound pitch and tempo in Donkey Kong. [Mirko Buffoni]

- Improved music tempo in SlapFight. [Sebastien Chevalier]

- Improved Cop 01 (tempo is still wrong). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Sound in all of the working System 16 games. [Phil Stroffolino]

- Emulation of the Astrocade sound chip (Gorf, Wizard of Wor, etc.)
  [Frank Palazzolo]

- Improved speech in Gorf. It now plays speech 100% accurately except for the
  missing samples. [Kevin Bales]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

- Nemesis. [Dani Portillo]

- Terra Cresta, Rastan. [Juan Carlos Lorente]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Fixed hang on level 7 of Discs of Tron. [Jim Thevenot]

- Fixed Blasto. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Fixed controls in Stinger. [Miguel Figueiredo]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Switched to CRC-32 for file integrity checks. The old custom checksums are no
  longer used. [John Butler, Bernd Wiebelt]

- New unzip interface. New zip directory cache and filename cache (the latter
  only in the DOS version). [Andrea Mazzoleni]

- When using zipped files, ROMs are automatically retrieved even if they don't
  have the expected name (provided they have the correct CRC-32, of course).
  You'll never have to rename files any more (though you might have to rename
  zips ;-) [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] New command -listcrc. It lists the CRC-32 for all the supported ROMs.
  00000000 means that the ROM is known to be bad. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Some improvements to the cheat system. [JCK]

- Fixed bug in the 68000 interrupt handling which causes Rastan Saga to not
  boot correctly. [Brad Oliver]

- [DOS] Experimental profiler. To enable it, use the -profiler parameter; then,
  hit Left Shift + F11 to show the results on screen. I don't know how accurate
  the figures are; the "Sound" figure is certainly underestimated for sound
  chip emulators which don't use streams.c (it is computed under the CPU
  playing the sound instead that under Sound).
  Note that the sum of the percentages is much less than 100%. This is in part
  due to portions of the code which are not profiled, but is also caused by the
  massive overhead of calling uclock() (which happens very often when sound is
  playing). [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- New streams.c to abstract audio streams. This makes them easier to use and
  more efficient. osd_play_streamed_sample() should now be considered a private
  function and should not be used in new code. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Completed the transition to CRC32 checksums. [John Butler, Bernd Weibelt]

- Fixed bug in the I8039 external interrupt handling. [Dan Boris]

- New file types for osd_fopen(): OSD_FILETYPE_STATE and OSD_FILETYPE_ARTWORK.


NeoGeo Mame Support
-------------------

This beta contains a major update to the NeoGeo driver.  It is still far from
perfect but has many improvements over the previous version.  This is still
very much a 'work-in-progress' driver with many known problems.  Hopefully
these problems will be fixed soon.

How to:

You need a zip file called neogeo.zip in your rompath.  It should contain at
least two files:

neo-geo.rom (128k)
ng-sfix.rom (128k)

There should also be two other roms which are not yet used by Mame, they _will_
be used in future versions of this driver so do not delete them.

You also need to place the game zip in your rompath.  If you do not know what 8
character filename the NeoGeo game you want to play has you can type:

mame -listclones neogeo

That will list the 8 character zip names of all currently supported games.

What's New?
-----------

Many graphics improvements:
* 'Missing tiles' in games such as Puzzle Bobble are fixed.
* Scaling is improved, but still not perfect.  Full screen zooms tend to break
  (eg, Thrash Rally, Art of Fighting).
* 'Japan/Europe/USA' territory selection in dipswitch menu.
* Start & coin key positions are moved to their 'standard' MAME positions
* Coin inputs work, freeplay is no longer the default.
* Soft dipswitches are fully emulated and saved per game, the files are saved
  to the hiscore directory for now.
* Custom drawgfx routine in place.  This is slower than the previous MAME
  release but allows the graphics to be drawn from their native data.  This
  allows:
* MEMORY REQUIREMENTS APPROXIMATELY HALVED!  And also quicker loading time.
* If you experience a 'black screen' for a few seconds after loading it is
  because the 'pen usage' arrays are being calculated.  MAME NeoGeo uses a
  compressed palette system to give the full NeoGeo 12 bit colour on an 8 bit
  display.  (This is nothing new, almost every other MAME driver for high
  colour games works in the same way, by choosing only the colours that are
  actually displayed at any one time).  Although this gives better quality it
  actually takes around 10-15% of the processor time each frame.
* There is no 'black screen' at the end of each games demo. All games now
  behave as per the arcade version and cycle to the 'NeoGeo logo' screen.


Notes on soft dipswitches:  You can access these from pressing F2 (self test)
or setting the test mode dipswitch and resetting the virtual machine. Both soft
dips and cabinet settings are saved for each game. If, for some reason, you
experience strange gameplay (NOT graphics glitches), the soft dips may have
become corrupt (this _is_ still a beta release!), to clear them you can wipe
the file in the hiscore directory for the game OR go into the hardware test and
select the 'clear backup ram' option (recommended).

Other Fixes
-----------

Emulation of soft dips fixed many problems games had in previous versions, for
example, the game timers being set low in games such as KOTM and Art of Fighting
are fixed. Almost all 'gameplay' issues are fixed by this.

Sidenote: The 'blood bios' is not needed, nor supported.  All games affected by
the blood bios actually have the 'blood' option in their soft dip options.  It
can be turned on & off there without having to use a special bios.  In fact any
non-standard bios may not work at this point.

Due to the much decreased memory requirements large games such as Karnov's
Revenge now work.

What isn't fixed?
-----------------

'New' games such as Metal Slug, Pulstar, Shock Troopers do not work, either due
to protection or bankswitching used in these games (information needed!).

The animation in the 'rain' scenes of Karnov's Revenge does not animate!

As mentioned before, full screen zooms are not correct.

The MVS memory card is not supported.

(Probably many other small bugs too).

And finally:
------------

Q: Why don't you MAME guys do something original instead of doing something
   that's already done?
A: Tell that to a Mac/Arm/Amiga owner!

Q: It's a bit slow...
A: The custom graphics draw routine will be improved soon! It was felt that the
   slowdown was merited due to the advantages of halving memory usage.

  for you now, increase the gamma correction value. [Bernd Wiebelt]

- Fixed sprite priorities and tile flip in Pinball Action. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed Motos High Score display. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Moon Cresta uses the original gfx ROMs, fixing graphics glitches on the title

  it handles timers in software. osd_ym3812_status and osd_ym3812_read removed.
  [Aaron Giles]

- Emulated sound in Yie Ar Kung Fu (speech is missing for now) [Nicola Salmoria]

  it will disable coins. Of course you can set the dip switches to Free Play
  and forget about coins.

- Service mode in Centipede and Millipede works. [Brad Oliver]

- Added support for coin counters to some games. [Brad Oliver]

- Heavy Barrel is playable to the end, but there are still some problems.
  [Bryan McPhail]

- Improved speed in the CPS1 games. [Paul Leaman]

- Fixed speed in Berzerk/Frenzy [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Adjusted timing in the vector games. [Bernd Wiebelt]

- Another step forward in getting Super Punch Out to work (still NOT
  playable). [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Proper emulation of the ROM decryption in Burger Time. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Improved Spy Hunter controls (you can play with the mouse or even a wheel
  now). [Alex Judd]

- Changed the 6502 emulation to disable interrupts on a reset. Not sure if
  this is the correct behavior, but Centipede needed it for the service mode
  to work.

- Support for the complete Curveball set. This also fixes the crash.

- Many improvements to the DECO games, especially Heavy Barrel. [Bryan McPhail]

- Sped up Route 16. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Lots of clean up, consolidation, dip switches additions, color fixes to the
  Carnival driver (which is now called vicdual.c, since Carnival is just one of
  the many games which run on that hardware). [Marco Cassili]

- Slowed down a little the Sega raster games.

- You can assign a joystick button to the gear shift in Spy Hunter.

- Red Alert accepts coins. [Mike Balfour]

- Mapped the unknown dip switch in Wonder Boy Deluxe. [David Calandra]

- Fixes to the Gameplan games. [Santeri Saarimaa]

- Us vs Them is playable, though of course you can't see the backgrounds which
  were stored on the laser disc. MACH 3 still doesn't work.

- Fixed bug in the I8086 emulator which caused MACH3 not to work. MACH3 now
  does the attract mode, but it will never be playable without the laser disc.

- Fixed Snow Bros hanging after level 30. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed hangs in Tapper, and hopefully other MCR games as well. [Aaron Giles]

- Some fixes to Quantum. [Paul Forgey]

- The default scores in Paperboy and Super Sprint are correct (though of course
  you must delete the .HI files) [Aaron Giles]

- Super Qix might be running at the proper speed now. [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- [DOS] Increased the default gamma correction to 1.2. This will not have
  effect unless you change it in MAME.CFG (or just delete the file).

- [DOS] Set back the default vgafreq to -1 (=auto). This is necessary for
  -vsync to pick the correct freq (most of the time) when used with tweaked
  VGA modes. This will not have effect unless you change it in MAME.CFG
  (or just delete the file).

- Fixed -ror and -rol with ORIENTATION_SWAP_XY games (e.g. Kick) and
  ORIENTATION_FLIP_X games (e.g. Discs of Tron). [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] -vsync is supported for games running at 57fps (e.g. Moon Patrol).
  However, due to the sync rate being different, the game runs 6% faster than
  it should. [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] New -listgames command, which lists all games along with production
  year and manufacturer.
  Also -noclones option which removes clones from -list, -listfull etc.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] Fixed the NTSC mode. For feedback on this mode, please contact
  sta@carinthia.com [Zerza]

- [DOS] Allegro (3.0+diffmay) now supports SideWinders and Gravis Gamepad Pro's
  and so does Mame. [Bud Crittenden]

- Emulating analog devices via joystick no longer deactivates the mouse.
  IMPORTANT NOTE FOR PORTERS: osd_analog_read() had to be changed.
  The mame.cfg setting for joysticks was renamed to "joystick" instead of
  "joytype". The numbering of joystick types has changed, look into
  readme.txt [Bernd Wiebelt]

- Close to accurate 68000 instruction timing. [Brian Verre]

- Slightly improved speed of the 68000 emulator. [Darren Olafson]

- Some game information is displayed in the introduction screen.
  The copyright disclaimer and driver credits screens are shown only the first
  time a game is run. The game information screen is always shown since it may
  contain important info.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] New -listdetails option, to create a detailed list of drivers and the
  hardware they use. [Santeri Saarimaa]

- Improved handling of 4 way joysticks. [Martin Sandiford]

- [DOS] Modified the code so that to start a game you can use
  a) the full game name as listed in "mame -listfull"
  b) any ordered subset of the characters used in the full game name

  So you can start Asteroids Deluxe like:

  mame "Asteroids Deluxe"         !note the quotes!
  mame astdelx
  mame adlx

  The less characters you use, the more likely you'll be surprised which
  game actually gets chosen. [Bernd Wiebelt]

- [DOS] To improve compatibility, older VESA modes are back. If your card
  doesn't work in VESA mode, try "vesamode=vesa2b" or "vesamode=vesa1" in
  mame.cfg [Bernd Wiebelt]

- [DOS] Slightly changed the resolution picker, so that when -vesa and
  -noscanlines are requested, it will use e.g. 320x240 instead of 640x480
  with pixel doubling, and 400x300 instead of 800x600 with pixel doubling.
  If the lower res mode is not available, it automatically switches back to
  the pixel doubled mode. [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] New -listclones command, which lists in two columns the clones and the
  game they are clone of. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Changed the AY8910 emulation to generate three separate audio streams for the
  three channels instead of premixing them. This improves audio quality,
  increases the volume, and doesn't seem to affect performance too much.
  [Nicola Salmoria]


Source:
-------

- The DOS version is now compiled with GCC 2.8.1 and using Allegro 3.0 + WIP
  (30th May).

- [DOS] To improve portability, the makefile is more conservative, using the
  -pedantic and -Wshadow switches. Note that to compile with these switches,
  several changes had to be made to allegro.h, which is included.

- Drivers that dynamically change the palette are no longer required to
  initialize it in convert_color_prom(); they also can avoid initializing the
  color table, if the default layout for it (a 1:1 mapping) fits their needs.
  This is also useful when starting new drivers: you don't need to provide a
  fake palette or prom conversion function, the graphics will be visible
  somehow (but badly, so you had better change the defaults soon ;-) )
  Also, games using PROMs don't need to initialize the colortable if the
  GfxDecodeInfo structure is properly initialized to make the correspondence
  1:1.

- Further changes to the palette handling code.
  - osd_create_display() no longer takes the total_colors, palette, pens
  arguments. They are handled by osd_allocate_colors(), which is called after
  osd_create_display().
  - the convert_color_prom() functions now take a unsigned short *colortable
  parameter instead of unsigned char *.
  - Drivers for games which have a FIXED palette (i.e. they don't call
  osd_modify_pen()) of more than 256 colors are now allowed to declare it as
  such in the MachineDriver. The palette will be automatically shrinked to fit
  in 256 colors. Note: this assumes that the palette is actually composed of
  no more than 256 unique colors. This is currently the case in all the games.
  Examples: Kung Fu Master, Lode Runner, Arkanoid, Popeye.
  - instead of calling osd_modify_pen(Machine->pens[color],r,g,b), drivers
  should call palette_change_color(color,r,g,b). Note that the function does
  the Machine->pens[] mapping for you.

- Dynamic palette support for games with >256 colors.
  Drivers who want to use it must first of all set up like
  the static palette ones (put the real number of colors in MachineDriver->
  total_colors, etc.), and call palette_recalc() in vh_screenrefresh() before
  drawing anything. A color usage table must be set before calling
  palette_recalc() so that the function knows which colors are needed.
  To help drivers in better optimizing video refreshes, palette_recalc()
  returns a pointer to an array indicating which colors have been remapped and
  need a refresh. If you don't need it (most likely), you can just consider it
  a boolean value (0 = no need to redraw). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Drivers using the VIDEO_SUPPORTS_16BIT mode must use the same API as
  VIDEO_MODIFIES_PALETTE ones (palette_change_color(), palette_recalc()). The
  old setgfxcolorentry() method is discontinued.
  To use the new API, you must set BOTH the VIDEO_SUPPORTS_16BIT and the
  VIDEO_MODIFIES_PALETTE flags. Removing the _16BIT flag is all it takes to
  switch from 16-bit to dynamic mode, so you can quickly test if the palette
  can be compressed (_16BIT is much slower, so don't use it unless absolutely
  necessary). [Nicola Salmoria]

- On the Mac, the dynamic palette uses 254 colors instead of 256. Due to this,
  now ALL drivers using VIDEO_MODIFIES_COLOR and 256 colors must call
  palette_recalc() like the others. Also be warned that 256 colors static
  palettes will be shrinked, so if you are using colors for copybitmap()
  transparency you'll have to make sure that they are assigned an unique pen.

- IMPORTANT: drawgfx(...,TRANSPARENCY_THROUGH) now requires the caller to
  do the mapping with Machine->pens[]. This was necessary to allow for
  TRANSPARENCY_THROUGH, palette_transparent_color in dynamic palette games.

- Color PROMs no longer have to be included in the source. They can be loaded
  from disk just like the other ROMs. You just have to replace the color_prom
  pointer with the PROM_MEMORY_REGION() macro, to tell the core where the PROMs
  have been loaded. [Nicola Salmoria]

- For drivers using the GfxLayer system, dirty rectangle support is partially
  built-in into the core. The OS dependent rendering functions must use
  Machine->dirtylayer to know which portions of the screen need to be
  refreshed. Drivers which use the GfxLayer system no longer need the
  VIDEO_SUPPORTS_DIRTY flag in the MachineDriver structure - it must be turned
  on automatically by the OS dependent code.

- Added support for undocumented Z80 opcodes to the C Z80 core. [Juergen
  Buchmueller]

- Improved speed of the C 68000 core. [Juergen Buchmueller]
  (this is supposed to give a good speed increase, but I don't see any
  appreciable difference on my K6 - Nicola)

- Added WatchPoint support to the debugger (i.e. check a RAM location and stop
  execution when it is changed). [Ernesto Corvi]

- Fixed a bug in 6502/dasm.c (this only applies if you compile it to get a
  standalone disassembler - it is not part of MAME) [Christophe Verre]

- Fixed bug in the 6809 disassembler. [Keith Wilkins]

- T11 CPU emulator. This is used by the Atari System 2 drivers. [Aaron Giles]

- I8085 emulator. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- The 68000 memory handlers can again be word-aligned instead of
  longword-aligned. [Aaron Giles]

- New flag IPF_RESETCPU for input ports. When this flag is set, CPU #0 is
  reset when the key is pressed. This cleaned up the vicdual driver.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Several fixes to improve Unix portability. [Hans de Goede]

- Sygnetics 2650 emulator [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Improved cycle counting in the 6809 emulator. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

- Added new fields to the GameDriver structure:
  "source_file" (set it to __FILE__, this is used to automatically generate
  reference lists);
  "clone_of", used to link clones to the main version of the game.
  "year" and "manufacturer", for production year and company;
  "flags", for various info (currently only GAME_NOT_WORKING is defined).

- [DOS] The average FPS is printed on exit. [Nicola Salmoria]

- [DOS] Included Neil Bradley's asm M6808 emulator. Note: you need NASM to
  compile. The official DOS binary of NASM is a 16-bit application and it
  cannot compile this file; either use a recompiled version, or just use
  NASMW (of course the latter only works under Windows). [Alex Pasadyn]

- The (*vh_update)() call has an additional parameter, full_refresh. When it
  is 0, the driver may assume that the screen has not been altered by the main
  engine since the last call, and do an incremental update instead of redrawing
  the full screen.  [Brad Oliver]

- For convenience, added some commonly used palette read/write functions to
  palette.c. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Support for 16 bit samples in sndhrdw/samples.c.
  IMPORTANT NOTE FOR PORTERS: for consistency with the sound libraries,
  osd_play_sample_16() and osd_play_streamed_sample_16() now want the length in
  _bytes_ of the array, instead of the length in _shorts_ as it was before.
  [Peter Clare]

- Added the I8039 to the debugger, using Mike Cuddy's disassembler.
  [Andrea Mazzoleni]

==========================================================================

0.31

SOME DEFAULT SETTINGS HAVE CHANGED. MAKE SURE TO DELETE MAME.CFG TO MAKE THEM
UP TO DATE.

BEFORE COMPLAINING THAT 0.31 IS SLOWER THAN 0.30, READ THIS WHOLE SECTION, OK?
ESPECIALLY WHERE IT TALKS ABOUT 16 BIT COLOR SUPPORT.
You'll need -depth 8 and -sr 11025 to run some of the bigger games at an
acceptable speed.

In the MS-DOS version, some games might require you to increase the memory
available to DPMI.


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Accurate colors in:

  Roc'n Rope [Paul Swan]
  Frogger [Gerald Vanderick]
  Traverse USA [Gerald Vanderick]
  Donkey Kong 3 [Tim Lindquist]
  Minefield (apart from the background which is approximate) [Al Kossow]
  Circus Charlie [Paul Swan]
  Hyper Sports [Paul Swan]
  Iron Horse [Paul Swan, Gerald Vanderick]
  Zaxxon [Gerald Vanderick]
  Millipede [Nicola Salmoria]
  Shao-Lin's Road [Gerrit Van Goethem]
  Radarscope (probably) [Andy White, Tim Lindquist]
  Kangaroo [Mike Balfour]
  Rally X [Gary Walton, Simon Walls]
  Locomotion [Kevin Klopp]
  Swimmer [Gary Walton, Simon Walls]
  Pooyan [Martin Binder]
  Motos [Aaron Giles]

- Consolidated the Exidy drivers. Accurate colors in Venture, Mouse Trap and
  Pepper 2. [Mike Balfour]

- Fixed aspect ratio in Major Havoc [Al Kossow]

- Fixed pixel doubled sprites in Exerion [John Butler]

- Proper overlay emulation in Circus. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Fixed double size sprites in Galaga when screen is flipped. [ehrhard@csd.de]

- Better colors in Blue Print. [Martin Searle]

- Fixed disappearing background at the end of the tunnel in Super Zaxxon.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Support for the complete Swimmer set. No more bad graphics. [Brad Oliver]

- Gradient filled background in Rescue and Minefield. [Mike Coates]

- New antialiasing code for the vector games. A bit slower than before, but it
  looks terrific. You can turn it off with -noantialias.
  Also two new options:
  -beam #         # in the range of 1.00 through 16.00 (# is float)
  -flicker %      % is optional (% is float), no number sets default flicker
                  valid range is 0.00 to 100.00 (0=none 100=maximum)
  -beam sets the width in pixels of the vectors, while -flicker makes them
  flicker to simulate the behaviour of a real monitor. [Andrew Caldwell]

- Improved handling of vector games. Battlezone and Major Havoc now do correct
  clipping. [Aaron Giles, Bernd Wiebelt]

- 16 bit color support for games which need it (e.g. Rastan, Gauntlet, Black
  Tiger, and many others). It is on by default, since it looks much better;
  of course it's also slower, so you can turn it off and revert to the previous
  8 bit downgraded palette using (in the DOS version) the -depth 8 command line
  option. [Aaron Giles]

- I discovered that Locomotion runs on (almost) the same graphics hardware as
  Rally X. This fixed the smoke which was using wrong graphics (and had instead
  to be drawn like the dots in the Rally X radar). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Improved the blitter for the Williams games. Sinistar now works correctly.
  [Aaron Giles, Brad Oliver]

- Fixed sprites in Gauntlet. [Aaron Giles]

- Merged the Qix and Zookeeper drivers, they now also support rotation.
  [John Butler]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- New YM2151 emulator, used by Rastan and others. [Jarek Burczynski]

- Improved YM2203 and YM2151 emulator, and DAC interface, with 16 bit samples
  support. (Use -sb 16 to turn on 16 bit samples). [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- AY8910 and SN76496 support 16 bit samples as well. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Improved ADPCM support, plus support for the OKIM6295 ADPCM chip. Several
  drivers use these. [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed sound in Exed Exes; it has one 8910 and two 76496, not two 8910.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added back speech sample support to Q*Bert. [John Butler, Howie Cohen]

- Sound in Zaxxon and Berzerk, through samples. [Alex Judd]

- Better speech in Gorf. [Alex Judd]

- Better sound in Nibbler. [Brian Levine]

- Fixed missing/bad sound effects in Jungle King. [Nicola Salmoria]

- A first attempt at sound in Donkey Kong 3 / Punch Out. These two Nintendo
  games use the same sound hardware as the NES console. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Music tempo and pitch in Locomotion, Time Pilot, Pooyan, Tutankham and
  Roc'n Rope should be accurate (I believe they all use the same sound board)
  [Jim Hernandez]

- Improved pitch in many games.

- Sound in Targ and Spectar (need samples). [Dan Boris]

- Fixed ADPCM sample support in Rastan. [Jarek Burczynski]

- Fixed sound pitch and Mario jump in Donkey Kong. [Howie Cohen, Brad Oliver]

- Speech in Mat Mania [Nicola Salmoria]

- Speech in Sinistar, through samples. [Howie Cohen]

- Sound in Fire Trap and Silkworm (Sound Blaster needed) [Nicola Salmoria]

- Music in Bubble Bobble (Sound Blaster needed) [Nicola Salmoria]

- Sound in Break Thru (Sound Blaster needed) [Bryan McPhail]

- Added support for missing samples to Donkey Kong Jr. [Howie Cohen]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

- Sidearms, Breakthru, Mikie, 1943 Kai, Shaolin's Road, pengoa.
  [Gerrit Van Goethem]

- The first time you play Q*Bert, Q*Bert Qubes, Krull, Mad PLanets,
  Three Stooges, the high scores are automatically initialized to the default.
  Note: your old high scores will be lost, sorry. [Nicola Salmoria]

- The first time you play Track'n Field and Hyper Sports the high scores are
  automatically initialized to the default. Your old high scores will NOT be
  be lost here ;-) [Nicola Salmoria]

- Astro Fighter. [Santeri Saarimaa]

- Tazz-Mania, Space Firebird. [Chris Moore]

- Targ, Spectar. [Mike Balfour]

- Fire Trap, Fantasy. [Dani Portillo]

- Fixed Espial. [Dani Portillo]

- Fixed scores over 100000 in Donkey Kong/Donkey Kong Jr. [Wiebo de Wit]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Added the missing third button to Iron Horse. [Stuart Campbell]

- Fixes to dip switches and input ports in several games. [Marco Cassili]

- Better collision detection in the Exidy games (most noticeable in Venture
  upper left room) [Mike Balfour]

- Added missing action button to Diamond Run. [Yves Colombani]

- Added Invulnerability dip switch to Japanese Ghosts'n Goblins.
  [mbeighau@iies.es]

- Fixed Bubbles. [Marc Lafontaine]

- Major cleanup of the Williams drivers. [Aaron Giles]

- Fixed disappearing guards and other wrong behaviours in Bagman which were
  caused by copy protection. [Jarek Burczynsk]

- Fixed crashes in Rastan. [Barry Rodewald]

- Fixed service mode in Food Fight. [Aaron Giles]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- New -norotate option. This is supposed to disable all internal rotations
  of the image, therefore displaying the video output as it is supposed to be
  (so you need a vertical monitor to see vertical games). However, many
  drivers still don't use MAME centralized rotation, but instead rotate the
  image on their own, so -norotate has no effect on them.
  In some cases, the image will be upside down. To correct that, use
  -norotate -flipx -flipy, or use the Flip Screen dip switch if available.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed a bug in the 8086 emulator which caused unexpected deaths in Krull.
  [Fabrice Frances]

- Improved analog input handling. [Bernd Wiebelt]

- New 6808 emulator. [John Butler]

- Native .zip file support. [John Butler]

- Bugfix: "Dial Joy Inc" can now be properly set (e.g. Tron). [Brad Oliver]

- 6805 emulator, needed by Arkanoid. [Aaron Giles]

- High score load/save is disabled when -record or -playback is used. This
  prevents undesired side effects. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed 68000 emulator to properly handle interrupt priorities. [Aaron Giles]

- In the DOS version, screen snapshots are saved as "gamename.pcx" (the first
  one) and "nameNNNN.pcx" (the following ones), no longer the too generic
  "snapNNNN.pcx". [Nicola Salmoria]

- New commands -verifyroms and -verifysamples. They check an existing ROM
  set for missing and incorrect ROMs, and for missing samples. You can
  use "mame -verifyroms *" to check all your romsets.
  [Tormod Tjaberg]

- Reworked the automatic screen resolution picker. It now selects a resolution
  appropriate for the game's visible area, not the game's physical screen size
  (which is larger). [Nicola Salmoria]

- improved mame.cfg and commandline parameter handling:
  [Valerio Verrando, Maurizio Zanello, Bernd Wiebelt]
  * Added a few new config options (look into mame.cfg)
  * In mame.cfg, a [gamename] section can override global config options.
  * In the [directories] section, replaced ROMS and SAMPLES options with
    "rompath" and "samplepath", these take a standard DOS path as argument.
    (for example rompath=\callus;\raine;\retrocade;\mame\roms;.)
    This is option is also available on the commandline and in the
    [gamename] section.
  * Removed support for -savecfg.
  * Removed support for -width (e.g. -640) to select the resolution.
    You have to use -widthxheight (e.g. -640x480). Frontend authors
    are advised to use the new -resolution widthxheight semantics.
    "resolution" is also a mame.cfg option now.
  * Tweaked resolutions are directly selectable.
  * (DOS) Wildcard support for the frontend commands:
    "mame * -verifyroms"    will check all your existing romsets
    "mame a* -listfull"     will list all games starting with "a".
  * removed -vesa1, -vesa2b, -vesa2l. -vesa will try VESA 2.0 and fall back
    automatically.
  * playback data is stored in INP/gamename.inp
  * a boolean option can be specified as -option, -nooption, -autooption.

- added an NTSC video mode for use with a VGA2TV converter (this is definitely
  not the TV output some newer graphic cards offer). It is untested, use at own
  risk. More info: http://www.hut.fi/Misc/Electronics/circuits/vga2tv/
  [Zerza]

- Fixed bug in the 6808 emulation of TSX and TXS. [Larry Bank]

- Cleaned up the I86 emulator, including 286 instructions (but with 8088
  timing). [Fabrice Frances]

- Added support for HD63701YO extra opcodes to the M6808 emulation. [Ernesto
  Corvi]

  VERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR PORTERS: now the function osd_new_bitmap() must
  allocate also a "safety area" 8 pixels wide all around the bitmap. This is
  required because, for performance reasons, some graphic routines don't clip
  at boundaries of the bitmap.

- The DOS version is now compiled with GCC 2.8.0, optimized for Pentium.

- New timer-based event scheduler. This is a major change which is used
  throughout the code. See timer.c and cpuintrf.c to get an idea of the many
  things it does.
  One of the many benefits this has is that dip switches in Do's Castle now
  work, but there's an endless list of things affected. [Aaron Giles]

- New vblank_duration field in MachineDriver, which controls how long to
  delay screen refresh after a vblank interrupt. This is important to get
  video properly in sync in some games (e.g. sprites and background in
  Commando). [Aaron Giles]

- Memory for the 68000 is allocated automatically. You no longer have to do it
  yourself. The memory interface reads/writes 16 bits at a time to improve
  performance. Writing a single byte is a bit tricky, because the 68000 can
  cause write to either the high or the low byte without affecting the other;
  thus the second parameter for a 16-bit write is a bit more complicated.
  The top 16 bits are a mask which is supposed to be ANDed with the 16-bit
  value already in memory; the bottom 16 bits are the actual data values,
  to be ORed with the result. To aid in doing these operations, use the macros
  READ_WORD(), WRITE_WORD(), COMBINE_WORD() and COMBINE_WORD_MEM().
  [Aaron Giles]

- new function: cpu_setOPbaseoverride(). This function is called whenever the
  code jumps into an area of memory that is in a different bank than the
  current one (i.e., the code jumps from RAM to BANK1).
  It takes the destination PC as a parameter and returns a new PC which is to
  be used to determine which bank to switch to by the standard function.
  The main purpose of adding this is for slapstic coding. Empire Strikes
  Back and at least one of the System 1 games jumps to code in the slapstic
  memory region, but since we read the opcodes directly out of ROM, we never
  call the read handler. Although this won't solve the problem completely,
  we can at least detect when the code jumps into the slapstic memory region,
  and based on the registers and the PC, cause the proper bank switching to
  occur. [Aaron Giles]

- Improved debugger [Martin Scragg, Mirko Buffoni, John Butler]

- Moved the speed throttling code to the OS dependant stuff. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Support for Z80 daisy chain interrupts. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Migration to the new input port definitions is complete. The obsolete
  structures have been removed from struct GameDriver. [Marco Cassili]

- Better handling of sound susbsystems, thanks to new fields in the
  MachineDriver structure. You can now use several susbystems at the same time,
  without any problem and without having to write sh_start(), sh_stop() and
  sh_update() functions.
  Samples have a better interface too.

- There is some new graphics code, handling abstracted layers and optimized
  refresh. It is used only by a few drivers, and is still work in progress -
  don't use it in new code until further notice. [Phil Stroffolino,
  Nicola Salmoria]

  VERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR PORTERS: now the function osd_new_bitmap() must
  allocate also a "safety area" 8 pixels wide all around the bitmap. This is
  required because, for performance reasons, some graphic routines don't clip
  at boundaries of the bitmap.

==========================================================================

0.30

There have been some changes to the MAME licence, please check it in readme.txt.


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Accurate colors in Gunsmoke. [Paul Swan, Nicola Salmoria]

- Colors in Super Basketball should now be correct for real (the opponent's
  shirts weren't changing color in each level).
  [Marco Cassili, Nicola Salmoria]

- Accurate colors in Vulgus. [Pete Ground, Mirko Buffoni]

- Background in Millipede [Brad Oliver]

- Fixed sprites in Gunsmoke. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Emulation of AVG sparkling bit (Tempest stars/fireworks) [Brad Oliver]

- Fixed sprites and background in Sidearms. Colors should be correct as well.
  There probably is another scrolling background missing.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- A note about Zaxxon colors: we are aware that they are wrong. The reason is
  that we are using the Super Zaxxon color PROM. As soon as we'll have the
  correct Zaxxon color PROM, they will be fixed.

- Better colors in Eggs [Petter Sjlund]

- Appropriate blue background in Scramble, Super Cobra and other games
  running on the same hardware. [Mike Coates]

- Fixes to Star Wars brightness. [Bernd Wiebelt]

- Added the background starfield to Bosconian. [Martin Scragg]

- Slightly better colors in Locomotion. [Gonzalo Casas <gonzaloc@adinet.com.uy>]

- Fixed character colors in Black Tiger [Michael Appolo]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Changed the way 8910 sound is updated: there's no longer a fixed "updates
  per frame" value defined in the driver, instead the audio is stream is
  generated whenever a chip register is written to (and at every vblank).
  This improves sound quality in several games. [Nicola Salmoria]
- Same change to the POKEY interface. [Aaron Giles]

- YM2203 emulation not using the SoundBlaster OPL3 chip. This is more
  accurate than the previous one, which used the SoundBlaster OPL chip,
  however it is also slower. You can still revert to the old behaviour
  using the -fm command line option. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- YM2151 emulation. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Completely rewritten the 8910 emulator and interface. This affects a lot
  of games, but the one which benefits more is Gyruss: it now plays many
  sound effects which were missing. [Tatsuyuki Satoh, Fabrice Frances,
  Nicola Salmoria, Pete Ground]

- Full emulated sound in Gyruss. You can remove all the samples, they are no
  longer needed. Also, music tempo should now be correct.
  Due to the increased emulation overhead, it now runs slower than before.
  To improve speed, you can use the new -sr option (see below) to lower the
  sample rate. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Cleaned up the SN76496 emulation, now it is similar to the 8910 one and all
  games use Tatsuyuki's code. This affects several games, most notably the
  Mr. Do! series. [Tatsuyuki Satoh, Nicola Salmoria]

- 8039 emulator, and _emulated_ sound in Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr.  and
  Mario Bros. Since the boards also use discrete circuits to generate sound,
  some samples are still needed to get complete sound support.
  Also partial sound in Radarscope.
  [Ron Fries, Dan Boris, Mirko Buffoni]

- Sound (through samples) in Yie Ar Kung Fu [Phil Stroffolino, Kevin Estep]

- Completely rewritten the Namco waveform audio subsystem. This gets rid of
  some artefacts in pacMan (eating a ghost) and Ms Pac Man (eating dots
  while a fruit is bouncing). [Nicola Salmoria, Aaron Giles]

- TI TMS5220 emulator. This handles speech in Star Wars and other games.
  [Frank Palazzolo]

- Speech in Discs of Tron. [Aaron Giles]

- Sound in Three Stooges. Actually the code had always been there, it just
  had to be activated... [Fabrice Frances]

- Music tempo in Scramble, Frogger, Amidar and derivatives should now be
  correct [Frank Palazzolo]

- Music in Spy Hunter, sound in Rampage. [Aaron Giles]

- Sound in Qix. [Aaron Giles]

- Sound in Super Basketball [Nicola Salmoria]

- Sound in Rastan [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Sound in Naughty Boy and Pop Flamer, using the Pleiads driver. Not very
  good, but it's a start. [Brad Oliver]

- Sound in Espial. [Brad Oliver]

- Fixes to Missile Command. [Eric Anschuetz]

- Music in Phoenix, via samples. [Brad Oliver]

- Partial emulated sound in Bubble Bobble (only the YM2203 chip, therefore
  only some sound effects - no music) [Nicola Salmoria]

- Sound in Coors Light Bowling [Nicola Salmoria]

- Better tempo and pitch in Blue Print [Alan J McCormick]


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

- Fixed Asteroids [Brad Oliver]

- Legendary Wings, Section Z, Espial, Black Tiger, Gunsmkoke. [Juan Carlos
  Lorente]

- Fixed Popeye. [Juan Carlos Lorente]

- 1943. [Jeff Johnson]

- Tac/Scan, Star Trek, pacmanbl, Red Ufo [Valerio Verrando]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- A note about Tempest:
  Several people complained that mouse control is reversed. This is not the
  case. The more obvious place where this can be seen is the level selection
  screen at the beginning: move the mouse right, the block goes right.
  Anyway, you can now reverse the controls (see below).

- Radarscope works. [Andy White]

- Dirty rectangles support in Qix, all Williams games, Cloak & Dagger,
  Berzerk, Arabian, Space Invaders & clones, Kangaroo, Space Panic,
  Warp Warp. [Aaron Giles]

- Some tweaks to dip switches in the Super Cobra / Lost Tomb / Rescue
  driver. [James R. Twine]

- Fixes to dip switches and input ports in several games. [Marco Cassili]

- Space Panic supports rotation. [Mike Coates]

- Fixed Invinco (it was missing a ROM) [Mike Coates]

- Framerates in the Atari vector games should now be correct [Neil Bradley]

- In Cloak & Dagger, the background bitmap is now aligned properly with the
  playfield graphics, and boxes no longer get stuck at the corners of the
  conveyors [Dan Boris]

- Added the missing third button to Sidearms [Nicola Salmoria]

- Spy Hunter displayes an extra line of text at the bottom indicating
  the status of the lamps that were on the arcade machine.[Aaron Giles]

- Fixed Bosconian crashing: This was the speech processor being used for a
  protection check. [Martin Scragg]

- Alternate controls in Defender and Stargate, to control the ship using the
  standard 8-way directional controls instead of up/down/reverse/thrust.
  Available only when the -cheat option is specified. [Maurizio Zanello]

- Alternate controls in Battle Zone, Sarge, Defender and Stargate are
  available only when the -cheat option is specified. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Better emulation of the custom I/O chip in the Namco games. [Aaron Giles]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Right control and right alt work again. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Enhancements to the analog input controllers emulation. Their keyboard
  counterparts can be changed, the sensitivity adjusted, and the direction
  reversed. This is all controlled by the analog setup menu. [Brad Oliver]

- Support for true analog joystick input in games like Star Wars; moreover,
  the whole range of joystick types supported by Allegro is now supported.
  To handle that, use the new command line option -joy N, where N can be
  0 - normal 2 button joystick
  1 - CH Flightstick Pro
  2 - Stick/Pad with 4 buttons
  3 - Stick/Pad with 6 buttons
  4 - dual joysticks
  5 - Wingman Extreme (or Wingman Warrior without spinner)

  Press F7 to calibrate the joystick. Calibration data will be saved in
  mame.cfg. If you're using different joytypes for different games,
  you may need to recalibrate your joystick every time.

  Note that if you enable joystick support, games like Star Wars will work
  ONLY with the joystick - mouse emulation will be disabled.
  [Bernd Wiebelt]

- When the -vsync option is specified, the program checks whether the video
  mode is compatible with it (i.e. whether the video refresh rate is a
  multiple of the target frame rate), and fails otherwise. Some sensible
  default values for -vgafreq are built-in and automatically picked when
  -vsync is requested.
  It is also possible to successfully use -vsync with scanline video modes.
  Note that for VESA modes you might have to configure your card in order
  to make it use the 60Hz refresh rate.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Support for default configuration file. Start MAME with the -saveconfig
  parameter, and the current configuration will be saved to mame.cfg,
  becoming the default. You can still override the mame.cfg settings giving
  parameters on the command line. [Valerio Verrando]

- Modified the tweaked video modes to be as close as possible to 60Hz.
  However please note that on some systems the new modes might not work,
  while the old do. You can work around that by changing the line
  syncedtweak=yes to syncedtweak=no in mame.cfg [Valerio Verrando]

- The default directory for screen snapshots (F12) is now PCX instead of the
  current directory, so make sure you create it or snapshots will not be
  saved. [Valerio Verrando]

- New command line options, -sr N, where N is the required audio sample rate,
  and -sb N, where N is the number of sample bits (8 or 16).
  For example,
  mame gyruss -sr 22050 -sb 16
  will use a 22kHz sample rate and 16 bits.
  The -sb option currently doesn't change anything because none of the audio
  subsystems support 16 bit samples.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- You can keep the ROMs in a subdirectory called "ROMS", if you want to.
  When loading ROMs for 'gamename', the program will look in these
  directories in this order:
  1) gamename
  2) gamename.zip
  3) ROMS\gamename
  4) ROMS\gamename.zip
  The same applies to samples, you can put them in a subdirectory called
  SAMPLES - therefore separating them from the ROMs.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Samples can also be loaded from a common directory for variations of the
  same hardware. For example, all Space Invaders clones will load samples
  from the invaders directory. [Valerio Verrando]

- In the DOS version, dirty rectangles are supported in all resolutions.
  [Bernd Wiebelt]

- Several changes to the cheat subsystem [James R. Twine, Marc Lafontaine]

- Fixed bug in drawgfx() which caused Crazy Climber's big sprites to be
  corrupted when horizontally flipped. [Vince Mayo]

- New options, -record and -playback. They allow you to record, and later
  playback, joystick input. Useful to document certain bug reports, or to
  show your friends how good you are ;-)

- New option -romdir which allows to specify a different directory where to
  load the ROMs from. [Mike Balfour]

- High score and configuration save now support ZipFolders/ZipMagic to
  directly use .zip archives. If you want to use this feature, make sure
  there are no HI or CFG directories, otherwise the files will be saved
  there, not in the.zip archive. [Valerio Verrando]


Source:
-------

- Now using Allegro 3.0 - this fixed problems 0.29 had under NT with mouse
  enabled.

- Integrated debugger. You must compile with MAME_DEBUG defined to activate
  it. Start MAME with the -debug option, then press tilde to enter the
  debugger. [Martin Scragg, John Butler, Aaron Giles]

- cpu_setbankhandler_r() / cpu_setbankhandler_w() for better bank switching
  support. The Williams drivers take advantage of it. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Removed samples field from the MachineDriver structure; added sound_prom
  field to the GameDriver structure. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Some changes to the 68000 emulator memory interface, and a new 68000
  disassembler. Improved the 68000 cpu interface. [Aaron Giles]

- Redesigned cpuintrf.c to be more modular and readable. [Aaron Giles]

- added a cpu_reset() call so that a single processor can be reset during
  execution; Gauntlet needs this to work properly. [Aaron Giles]

- The 6502 supports bank switching via cpu_setbank(). [Aaron Giles]

- Centralized dac.c for dac sound emulation. Several dirvers use it.
  [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

SURE YOU MOVE THE OLD ONES TO THE NEW DIRECTORIES "CFG" AND "HI". This will
be done automatically by the provided batch file mov.bat, but PLEASE read
on for details.

NOTE: Bubble Bobble doesn't work in this release. We are aware of that. Use
Bobble Bobble or Super Bobble Bobble instead, they work much better than
Bubble Bobble ever did.


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- accurate colors in

  Donkey Kong Jr.
  Congo Bongo
  Phoenix
  10 Yard Fight
  Moon Patrol
  Pop Flamer
  War of the Bugs
  Espial (not sure about this one - red and blue could be inverted)
  Super Cobra
  Yie Ar Kung-Fu
  Mario Bros.
  Super Basketball
  Seicross
  1943
  Donkey Kong 3 (well, not really)
  Gyruss

- accurate colors in Bagman and Super Bagman
  [Tim Lindquist, Jarek Burczynski]

- accurate colors in Naughty Boy (probably) [Virtu-Al, Nicola Salmoria]

- Minor fix to Donkey Kong colors (black was dark blue). [Nicola Salmoria]

- Clouds in Time Pilot are correct. [Edward Massey]

- Lives left are correctly displayed in Burger Time, sprites are turned off
  appropriately, and the switch test in test mode works correctly.
  The hardware of this game is more similar to Eggs than I thought.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Some fixes to 10 Yard Fight. [John Butler]

- The background was clipped too low in Phoenix. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added the missing scrolling background to Exed Exes. [Nicola Salmoria]

These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- All the Williams games. Samples are no longer needed and may be deleted.
  [Steven Hugg, Mirko Buffoni, Nicola Salmoria]

- Q*Bert Qubes. You just have to use Q*Bert's sound ROMs, they are the
  same. [Fabrice Frances]

- Tac/Scan (through samples). [Brad Oliver]

- Fixed some sound problems in Asteroids. [Andrew Scott]

- Added music to Kick. [Aaron Giles]

- Improved the Galaxian background hum, it also is no longer incorrectly
  played in Moon Cresta & others. [Andrew Scott]

- Digital audio in the Taito games (used for some sound effects, most
  notably Tarzan's yell in Jungle King). Also, music plays in Jungle King.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Moon Patrol, 10 Yard Fight, Kung Fu Master. [Aaron Giles]

- Mario Bros (partial, through samples). [Brad Oliver, Shane Monroe]

  [Juan Carlos Lorente]


Other drivers improvements:
---------------------------

- The attract mode of Galaga works correctly. Qix runs correctly and
  without slowdowns. Test mode in Mr. Do's Castles & family works correctly,
  (dip switches in Do's Castle still don't work).
  All these changes are due to the interleaved CPU execution described
  below. [Nicola Salmoria]

- New fix to avoid lockup in Tempest after 150,000 points - this one should
  really work. [Keith Gerdes]

- Fixed the Fantasy driver. [Brian Levine]

- Several fixes and enhancements to the Williams driver. [Aaron Giles]

  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Some fixes to the Star Wars mathbox. [Aaron Giles]

- The hardware of the Taito games (Elevator Action, Jungle King, Wild Western,
  Front Line) is emulated more faithfully. Playfield priority is accurate in
  Jungle King, however this broke Wild Western - strange.
  Front Line works.
  Merged all the drivers into taito.c [Nicola Salmoria]

- Tried to plug Triple Punch into the Scramble driver, but it doesn't work.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Support for New Rally X; colors are accurate in New Rally X ONLY - still
  wrong in Rally X until we find the color PROMs. Sound should finally be
  correct, both in Rally X and New Rally X. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Video drawing optimization to Mappy, plus test mode now works both in Mappy
  and Dig Dug 2. [Aaron Giles]

- In some games (e.g. Pacman, Galaxian, Rally X) the NumLock and CapsLock
  leds emulate the 1 player/2 players start lamps. [Sean Gugler]

- Fixed dip switches in Missile Command. [Marco Cassili]

- Early attempt at a Zookeeper driver, based on the Qix one, which
  unfortunately doesn't work yet. [John Butler, Ed Mueller]

- Moved the Hunchback driver into dkong.c, since that's where it belongs (but
  it still doesn't work due to encryption). [Nicola Salmoria]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Added Gamma correction controls. Use Shift + Numeric pad +/- to change it.
  There are some games which are too dark on the default setting, instead of
  using the monitor settings use these controls to brighten the picture.
  Gamma correction also affects colors, like the girders in Donkey Kong.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Added a "Pro Action Replay"-like cheat finder. It is only available when
  -cheat is specified on the command line. [Marc Lafontaine]

- Some optimizations to the 6809 emulator. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Some optimizations to the 6809, and modified it to always fetch opcodes
  directly from RAM (much faster). The Ghosts 'n Goblins, Star Wars and
  Williams drivers needed reworking to support that. [Aaron Giles]

- Moved configuration and high score files to the CFG and HI subdirectories.
  They are not stored in the games subdirectories.
  I have provided a batch file (MOV.BAT) to automatically move your old
  settings in the new directories. Just start it from inside the MAME
  directory. It will spit out some error messages for missing files, don't
  worry and let it finish its job. [Nicola Salmoria]

  Having configuration files in a separate directory makes it easier to
  keep ROMs in .zip files. This is already done by some front-ends, but
  you can do it from the command line as well, just use this batch file.
  PKUNZIP must be in your path. The .zip files must be in the MAME directory
  and named after the game (i.e. pacman.zip).
@echo off
md %1
pkunzip >nul: %1 %1
MAME.EXE %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
deltree >nil: /y %1

  But even better, if you have ZipFolders or ZipMagic installed, MAME will
  automatically look into the .zip or .zif directory.
  ZipFolders and ZipMagic are trademarks of Mijenix Corporation. You can
  download a trial version from www.mijenix.com. I am in no way associated
  with Mijenix Corp. - I'm just a happy costumer.

- Removed "-trak" and "-mouse" options. Mouse support is now enabled by
  default. To disable it, use "-nomouse". [Bernd Wiebelt]

- "-vesa" picks the best VESA mode available. The new "-vesa1" forces VESA
  1.2. [Bernd Wiebelt]

- "-vg" removed. It is on by default now. [Bernd Wiebelt]


Source:
-------

- We are now using the "WIP 2.8" version of Allegro to compile the DOS
  version. You can get it from http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/.

- Two new OSD_KEY definitions: RCONTROL and ALTGR. CONTROL has been replaced
  by LCONTROL.

- Aligned to version 1.2 of Marcel de Kogel's Z80 emulator.

- New memory handling functions, about 10%-30% faster than before. Moved the
  memory code from cpuintrf.c to memory.c.
  Banked ROMs can now be handled in a cleaner and faster way. Use the new
  MRA_BANK1... types in the memory handler arrays, and cpu_setbank() to set
  the current bank. The Z80 and M6809 emulators natively support bank
  switching.
  IMPORTANT: for 24 bit addressing (i.e. 68000) you cannot associate a memory
  handler to a single byte. You must use four consecutive bytes, longword
  aligned. This was done to speedup word (2 bytes) and dword (4 bytes)
  operations.
  [Tatsuyuki Satoh, Aaron Giles]

- New ROM_LOADEVEN and ROM_LOADODD macros. [Aaron Giles]

- CPU execution is interleaved. The cpu_slices_per_frame field in the
  MachineDriver controls how often control is passed from one CPU to
  another. 1 is the minimum, meaning that each CPU runs for the whole video
  frame before giving control to the others. The higher this setting, the
  more closely CPUs are interleaved and therefore the more accurate the
  emulation is. However, an higher setting also means slower performance.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Removed osd_obtain_pen(), the palette is passed to osd_create_display()
  instead. Also moved clearbitmap() to osd_clearbitmap(), which does a
  slightly different thing from what clearbitmap() did: it sets the bitmap
  to be generically "black", which doesn't necessarily imply filling it
  with Machine->pens[0]. Avoid using osd_clearbitmmap() in drivers: use the
  new fillbitmap(), instead, which accepts a pen number and a clip region.
  [Nicola Salmoria]

- Replaced file related functions (fopen(), fread() and so on) with osd_
  equivalents. This avoids a good amount of hacking in the Mac port; plus
  it allows some system specific extensions, like supporting
  ZipMagic/ZipFolders under Windows 95. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Tweaked input port code. Added new fields for analog controls - clip,
  min, and max. Also added 2 new analog joystick types - IPT_AD_STICK_X and
  IPT_AD_STICK_Y.
  The new fields are packed into the same int field (arg) as the
  sensitivity and as such they can only be in the range of 0-255. The clip
  field clips the trackball/dial/stick deltas, a common callback routine
  task. Min and Max are so far only used in the AD_STICK types. They limit
  the range of motion for those sticks - used in Star Wars and Red Baron.
  [Brad Oliver]
  Additional tweaking of analog inputs, allowing them to be updated more
  than once per frame. This is needed by some games. [Bernd Wiebelt]

- removed osd_track_center(). We always use relative mouse movement now.
  [Bernd Wiebelt]

- Formalized support for dirty rectangles, via the function osd_mark_dirty().
  [Aaron Giles]
  It is mostly used by MacMAME, limited DOS support added by Bernd Wiebelt.

- updated pokyintf.c to be more like 8910intf.c. Variable clock frequency,
  port callbacks, a clipping parameter, variable updates per frame. Most
  noticeably, Tempest has much improved sound with more frequent updates.
  [Brad Oliver]

==========================================================================

0.28

Program:
--------

- Fabrice Frances added *emulated* sound to Q*Bert, Reactor, Krull and Mad
  Planets. The samples are no longer needed and may be removed.
  Q*Bert Qubes would work as well, if we had the sound ROM ;-(
  Speech is not emulated... yet! Please do not complain because there is no
  speech in Q*Bert. We are aware of that.

- John Butler provided a new 6809 emulator. It is faster than the previous
  one, and fixes some bugs including the ship moving in the wrong direction
  on the tower level of Star Wars and the bonus maze in Pac & Pal.

- John Butler also added optimizations to some Williams games, GnG and Qix.
  He also fixed several problems in Qix.

- Bernd Wiebelt provided a driver for Omega Race and added a "director's cut"
  mode to Battle Zone. DELETE BZONE\BZONE.CFG OTHERWISE THE GAME WILL NOT
  WORK CORRECTLY.

- Nibbler and Vanguard are back to (hopefully) normal speed.

- Christopher Kirmse, Aaron Giles and Brad Oliver provided a MCR I/II/III
  driver, supporting:
  Kick
  Solar Fox
  Tron
  Two Tigers
  Domino Man
  Satan's Hollow
  Wacko
  Kozmik Kroozr
  Journey
  Tapper
  Discs of Tron
  Demolition Derby
  Timber
  Spy Hunter
  Rampage

- Aaron Giles perfected the CTC emulation, needed by the MCR driver.

- Sean Trowbridge found a workaround to make Tempest not lock up at 150,000
  points.

- Mike Balfour (overload@primenet.com) did some fixes to the Exidy games
  (Venture, Mouse Trap, Pepper II)
  Collision detection is now supported, Venture is playable.

- Mike Balfour also added high score support to Elevator Action, Pisces, War
  of the Bugs, Eggs, Exed Exes, Diamond Run, Jungle King, Wizard of Wor,
  Robby Roto, Gorf, Space Zap, Seawolf II, Loco-Motion, Mysterious Stones,
  Blue Print, Carnival, Snap Jack, Cosmic Avenger, Yie Ar Kung Fu, Scramble,
  Battle of Atlantis and The End.

- Mike Balfour also pointed out that ROM 2H of Battle of Atlantis seems to
  be bad; that's the cause of the strange coins per credit values.

- Many thanks to Luis Longeri (llongeri@cbb.cl) for helpful tips about Exed
  Exes' background, which is now partially working.

- Tatsuyuki Satoh made several fixes to the Xevious driver.

- Aaron Giles provided a driver reference sheet (mamelist.txt)

- Steve Baines fixed color intensities in Star Wars - objects now fade out
  properly. You might find it a bit too dark now, but this is done to
  reproduce the differences in brightness that the original has.

- Frank Palazzolo fixed the "bad tranch vectors" and "fail to approach Death
  Star" bugs in Star Wars.

- David Winter provided a driver for Amigo (a bootleg version of Amidar)

- Brad Oliver provided drivers for Pop Flamer and Espial.

- Zsolt Vasvari supplied a Super Basketball driver.

- Marc Lafontaine provided a driver for Time Pilot 84. John Butler optimized
  it.

- Mirko Buffoni added explosions to Rally X, using a sample.

- Jarek Burczynski adapted the M68000 emulator from the System 16 Arcade Emulator
  by Thierry Lescot. The only known problem of this emulator is that it doesn't
  count CPU cycles, only instructions.
  The first driver to use the 68000 is Rastan, also provided by Jarek.

Sources:
--------

- New osd_modify_pen() function, proposed by Aaron Giles. It allows drivers
  to dynamically modify the palette. WARNING: since this feature can severely
  reduce performance on some systems, it must only be used when necessary -
  that is, when the emulated game dynamically modifies the palette. The other
  games should continue to use the static palette as before.
  Many games already use this feature (e.g. Crystal Castles, the Gottlieb
  games, Tapper, Bubble Bobble, and many others).
  There's also osd_get_pen(), which is used by usrintf.c to dynamically pick
  the pens used to render menus.


The following changes were done by Nicola Salmoria:

Program:
--------

- Crystal Castles now has accurate colors and load/save of high score and
  settings (I mean the settings done in the service menu).

- Nibbler and Fantasy have sound, using the Vanguard driver. I don't know
  how accurate it is.

- Thanks to Gary Walton and Simon Walls, Son Son now has accurate colors.

- Son Son also has sound.

- Since there are now many games which don't run at 60fps (e.g. Popeye and
  the vector games), F11 was confusing and lead people to think the emulation
  was slow, while it was running at the correct speed. F11 now  displayes the
  percentage of the speed of the real machine. 100% is the correct speed,
  200% is twice as fast, 50% is half as fast.

- Snap Jack and Cosmic Avenger are oriented correctly, and small sprites in
  Cosmic Avenger (bullets, bombs etc.) and Snap Jack (wheels) are properly
  supported.

- Some of the games now support Cocktail mode (only the graphics, not the
  controls yet)

- New command line option: "-cheat". Cheats like the speedup in Pac Man or
  the level skip in many other games are disabled by default. Use this switch
  to turn them on.

- The speedup cheat in Pac Man can now be permanently set to ON from the dip
  switch settings menu.

- Zaxxon and Congo Bongo can go in service mode (F2).

- Bank Panic support. Thanks to Virtu-Al, colors are correct.

- Colors in Donkey Kong are now 100% accurate. Several people complained that
  girders should be pink instead of red, but to the best of my knowledge the
  current colors are an accurate conversion of the color PROMs, and this has
  been confirmed by some people. There might be two different versions of
  Donkey Kong, with slightly different colors. If someone has a "pink" board
  and wants to read the PROMs from there, I'll be happy to include them.

- Dip switches now work in Xevious. Also fixed a bug in the targeting cursor
  colors (black corners while firing). Super Xevious works.
  Explosions are emulated with samples, thanks to Andrew Scott.

- Support for another version of Mr Do's Castle ("docastl2").

- Support for the Japanese version of Commando ("commandj").

- Thanks to Gary Walton, fixed sprite placement in Turtles.

Sources:
--------

- All-new handling of rotation. The GameDriver structure now has a
  "orientation" field which allows driver writers to handle fairly easily
  games which run on the same hardware but with different orientations.
  Crazy Climber/Crazy Kong, Lady Bug/Snap Jack/Cosmic Avenger and the Gottlieb
  games are examples of drivers using this feature.
  Rotation is handled automatically by gfxdecode(), which creates a prerotated
  charset, and drawgfx(), which swaps the arguments appropriately. Drivers
  which use only the standard functions to render their display will
  automatically handle the "orientation" field. If a driver writes directly to
  the bitmap, it must handle the rotation itself.
  IMPORTANT NOTE: osd_create_bitmap() swaps width and height when a rotation
  is requested. Take that into account or you'll risk trashing memory.
  IMPORTANT NOTE TO PORTERS: remember to update osd_create_bitmap() and
  osd_create_display() to take into account the rotation. Check msdos.c to
  see how this must be done.

- Totally new Input port definition structure. See driver.h for the new
  structures definition; several drivers already use it, check them for
  working examples.
  The new definition is much more powerful and easier to maintain than the
  previous one. It isn't complete yet, but it will eventually handle
  everything, including trackballs and analog joysticks. Drivers using the
  old definition will gradually be converted to the new one. Please do not
  submit new drivers using the old definition. It is obsolete and will be
  removed as soon as the conversion of the existing drivers is finished.

- Moved the input handling to the new source file inptport.c.

- Some driver compacting:
  - merged Pengo and Pac Man vidhrdw
  - merged Dkong and Dkong 3 driver and vidhrdw
  - merged Crazy Climber and Crazy Kong driver and vidhrdw
  - merged mooncrst, moonqsr and scramble vidhrdw into the new "galaxian.c"

- Rewritten the decryption routines in Pengo and Crazy Climber.

- MachineDriver/init_machine is now a void (*)(void), and the function is
  called by cpu_run() during a reset. Some games, like Espial and the MCR
  games, needed that to perform a reset correctly.

0.27

REMEMBER: IF A GAME DOESN'T WORK, TRY DELETING THE .CFG FILE IN ITS DIRECTORY

There has been much talk about the License under which MAME is released. We
had to drop the GPL because it was not applicable. See readme.txt for the new
rules.


Program:
--------

- The Energy shields in Vanguard now work.
  What about the speed of Nibbler, Vanguard and Fantasy? Are they too fast?

- Support for a GnG version with different graphics (cross instead of shield)

- Thanks to the precious information on the Pokey random number generator
  provided by Eric Smith, Hedley Rainnie and Sean Trowbridge, some problems
  with Centipede (start with 18 credits) and Tempest (hang after level 13)
  are now solved.

- Thanks to Virtu-Al and Peter Clare, Carnival now has 100% accurate colors.

- Mirko Buffoni and Tatsuyuki Satoh provided a preliminary Xevious driver.

- Al Kossow and Brad Oliver provided drivers for the Sega vector games
  (Eliminator, Space Fury, Star Trek, Tac-Scan, Zektor).
  Partial sound support (speech) is available through samples for some of
  them.

- Jarek Burczynsky provided better colors for Bagman and also added support
  for Super Bagman.

- Andrew Scott improved sound in Pleiads.

- Thanks to Virtu-Al, Rescue now has accurate colors.

- Lee Taylor (nxsl2819@defender.demon.co.uk) and John Clegg provided a
  Warlords driver.

- Andrea Fregoli added a scroll routine used when the keyboard/joystick
  settings menu doesn't fit on the screen.

- Andrew Scott and Robert R. Anschuetz II improved sound support in Galaxian
  and clones. The background noise is now emulated, while the shoot noise
  still requires a sample. These changes also affect other games using
  the same sound routines.

- Thanks to Brian Levine's freely available Rockulator, Andrew Scott was
  able to add sound support to Vanguard.

- Mike Coates improved again the Gorf driver. It's now (sort of) playable.

- Lee Taylor and John Clegg provided preliminary 10 Yard Fight support.

- Martin Scragg added Bosconian support.

- Aaron Giles did a major rewrite of his Super Pac man and Mappy drivers:
  - support for Dig Dug 2 and Pac & Pal
  - High score save in all games
  - 100% colors and sound samples (in Super Pac man the siren clicks a bit,
    but neither I nor jrok can figure it out; the sample data *is* correct)
  - better sound playback frequency (was missing some high bits!)
  - arcade accurate frequency calculation (thanks to jrok!)
  - removed all palette hacks; everything is clean
  - added loop optimizations for speed
  - video now properly displayed, including high priority characters

- John Butler and Aaron Giles fixed sound and trackball support in Millipede.

- Steve Baines, with the help of Frank Palazzolo and Brad Oliver, implemented
  Star Wars. It's playable, but far from perfect. There's even some
  preliminary sound support (slows the game down a lot).

- Bernd Wiebelt implemented a new option for vector games: "-vg".
  This adapts the Vector games to a given screen resolution (default 800x600).

- Lot of work on the Atari Vector games (Brad Oliver & Bernd Wiebelt)
  - Quite a few bugs hunted down.
  - Thanks to Aaron Giles, the Atari vector games do correct scaling
    now and we can do cycle counting on the vector CPU.
    Aaron also fixed the scaling in the Sega vektor games.
  - Tempest does no longer  crash after level 13, has better colors
    (colorram emulation) and is overall a bit faster.
  - Highscore saving for all games except Black Widow and Starwars
  - Trackball support for Tempest and Red Baron.
    Red Baron tries to calibrate its analog joystick at the start, so you'll
    have to move the "joystick" a bit before you can fly in all four
    directions. Thanks to baloo@kaiwan.com for his suggestions.
  - Mauro Minenna made Battlezone playable with one joystick.
  - Changes to game resolutions. On MSDOS, they now use tweaked VGA modes.

  REMEMBER TO DELETE EVERY *.CFG AND .HI FILE FOR VECTOR GAMES, OTHERWISE
  THE GAMES MIGHT NOT WORK CORRECTLY.

- Mike Coates added partial sound support (thru samples) to the Carnival driver.

- Bubble Bobble support, provided by Chris Moore (chris@aethos.co.uk).

- Son Son support (dedicated to Roberto Ventura! ;)

- Preliminary Exed Exes support, implemented by Richard Davies.
  Thanks to Paul Swan, it has 100% accurate colors.
  To do: find where tile ram is located and how it works, and whether banked
  ROMs contain code or only data. The structure of this game is similar to
  the other Capcom games.

- Mirko Buffoni and Tatsuyuki Satoh added Starforce sound emulation.

- Mike Coates tidied up the wow drivers, added definable keys to most games,
  and joystick & 2 player support to Seawolf II.

- Fabrice Frances added hiscore saving support to all Gottlieb drivers.

- Ray Giarratana included trackball support to Missile Command.

- Added support for Mr'Do vs Unicorns (earlier version of Do's Castle).
  Thanks to Lee Taylor for info)

- Sound support in Tutankham.

- Elevator action sound is perfect now.

- Improvements in Zaxxon colors by Marc Vergoosen.

- Jarek Burczynski changed showcharset() in usrintrf.c. Now you can use PGUP
  and PGDN to scroll through a charset which doesn't fit in the screen.

Sources:
--------

- Brad Oliver wrote the new sndhrdw/pokyintf.c file. It handles most of the
  pokey interface to pokey.c. Rather than call milliped_sh_start() or
  whatever, call pokeyx_sh_start(), where x is the number of pokeys. It will
  keep track of the pokey count and use the appropriate clipping. I'm not
  sure 3 pokeys is a possible combination so there is no such
  pokey3_sh_start() routine.

- Christopher Kirmse <ckirmse@ricochet.net> ported MAME to Win32.
  It compiles from the same source tree as the DOS version; to compile using
  visual c++ 5, just do
  nmake -fmakefile.w32
  To build mame32.exe, you also need the SEAL audio library for win32.

- Changes in SN76496 emulation (added SN76496UpdateB function to emulate 2
  chips on 8 channel PCM sound cards), added Z80PIO and Z80CTC emulator, in
  COMMON.C, 'TRANSPARENCY_PEN' and 'TRANSPARENCY_COLOR' mode were speeded up
  (for X/Y dual scroll games). All this was done by Tatsuyuki Satoh.

- Added generic EAROM routinges for the Atari Vector games, they
  are in src/machine/atari.c and src/machine/atari.h

- Bernd Wiebelt sincerely hopes he fixed the BCD-emulation in the 6502
  emulation. At least the authentic Tempest feeling (broken X/Y monitor) is
  gone, since the game now starts without pressing Fire.


The following changes were done by Nicola Salmoria:

Program:
--------

- You can now turn off speed throttling (F10) even on games which use audio
  streaming (i.e. all the ones with 8910 or Pokey sound chips)

- Loco-Motion support

- Blue Print support

- Thanks to F. Kurokawa, preliminary Snap Jack and Cosmic Avenger support.
  They run on the Lady Bug driver.

- Fixes to the audio code which should fix crashes on some games and
  compatibility problems with GUS and AWE 32. However let me stress once
  again that if you have an AWE 32 you should use the plain SoundBlaster
  driver. The AWE 32 driver sounds NOTHING like the original (and is slower).

- In Galaga, star scroll speed in levels > 32 should be correct now.

- Pressing ESC in all menus returns to pthe previous menu instead of quitting.

- Changed the 8910 sound chip emulation interface to allow updates more
  frequent than 60 per second. I also increased the sampling frequency to
  44.1kHz.
  These changes provide dramatic improvements in sound quality, which you can
  appreciate in e.g. Gyruss and Pooyan.
  The price to pay is slower execution. To make things worse, I had to
  (hopefully temporarily) remove some optimizations, so the above games will
  probably not run as well as before on slower systems.

- Donkey Kong has better colors. Are they entirely accurate?

- Preliminary driver for Eggs.

- Popeye runs at the correct speed of 30 fps.

- Increased the maximum number of digital audio channels from 8 to 16, so
  there are no more missing voices in the Mr. Do! games (Castle, Unicorns,
  Wild Ride, Run Run, and Kick Rider).

- Thanks to Gary Walton, speed in Pengo should now be closer to the original.

- The unencrypted versions of Penta and "pengopop" are no longer supported
  because they are just hacks, not coming from a real board.
  The *original*, *encrypted* versions are now supported instead. They are
  exactly the same, the only difference is that they are encrypted and come
  from real boards.
  The names now are:
  "pengo"  original Pengo with "PopCorn" music
  "pengoa" alternate version (earlier) with different music
           and no slow screen draw
  "penta"  the bootleg called Penta

- Elevator Action, Jungle King and Wild Western now use the same video hardware
  driver (taito.c)

- ROMs are checksummed before starting the emulation. If the checksum doesn't
  match, a warning message is printed on the screen (along with the expected
  checksums). Execution resumes after pressing Return.
  Not all drivers use this feature yet, but most of them do.

- Some alternate ROM sets supported: ckonga, galaganm, gallag, bzone2,
  asteroi2, panica, pacmanjp.

- Some ROM renaming here and there, just to annoy you ;-)

- Lots of minor fixes and enhancements.

- Exchanged the infamous two sprite banks in Moon Cresta.

Sources:
--------

- EXTREMELY IMPORTANT:
  osd_obtain_pen() now doesn't return pens sequentially. This ensures that
  MSDOS driver writers are aware of the existence of Machine->pens[] and
  use it appropriately. Drivers which don't do this will have wrong colors.

- modified readinputport() to scan the keyboard only once per frame, and
  handle everything more efficiently. It is now MUCH faster than before -
  useful with games which continuously poll a port for VBlank.

- generic_vh_start() now checks that videoram_size has been initialized and
  fails otherwise.

- When using TRANSPARENCY_COLOR and TRANSPARENCY_THROUGH with drawgfx(), the
  argument must now be the pen code instead of the remapped pen number, e.g.
  instead of Machine->background_pen (= machine->pens[0]) you just specify 0.
  I also removed the background_pen field from Machine: use Machine->pens[0]
  instead.

- The ROM_LOAD() macro now requires four parameters, the last one being the
  checksum. To quickly upgrade from previous sources you can be used
  (temporarily) ROM_OBSOLETELOAD(), however adding the checksum is easy (just
  do a cut & paste from the warning message) so it's better to put them in
  as soon as possible.

- New macro ROM_RELOAD(), meaning to reload the previous ROM at a different
  address (useful with 6502 games which need reset/irq vectors at FFFx).

- In common.c, new function printromlist(), used by loadroms() and mame.c.
  (-listroms).

- Drivers are now allowed to modify the RAM and ROM pointers to implement
  bank switching. Bubble Bobble uses this.
  Be careful: when using this feature, you cannot use the standard MRA_RAM
  and MWA_RAM memory hooks to access RAM.

- InputPorts now can automatically handle VBlank bits. No more need to write
  custom code. Lady Bug, Carnival, Mysterious Stones, Naughty Boy and Phoenix
  use this feature. Many other drivers need to be updated to use it.
  MAKE SURE TO DELETE LADYBUG\LADYBUG.DSW AND LADYBUG\LADYBUG.CFG, OTHERWISE
  THE GAME WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY.

- New support functions in cpuintrf.c:
  cpu_getfcount(), which returns the number of CPU cycles till the end of the
    current video frame (as opposed to cpu_geticount(), which  returns the
    number of CPU cycles till the next call of the interrupt handler)
  cpu_getiloops(), which returns the number of times the interrupt handler
    will be called before the end of the video frame (useful in interrupt
	handlers).
  cpu_gettotalcycles(), which returns the total number of CPU cycles passed
    since the CPU was reset.
  ignore_interrupt(), companion to interrupt() and nmi_interrupt(). This
    allows interrupt handlers to be cpu-independant, avoiding use of
	CPU-specific interrupt indetifiers.

0.26a

- This is a bug fix version.  I did a mess with the famous heavy modifications
  I mentioned before.  Well, I was the first to try the feeling of working on
  wrong sources ;)  Funny!!  BTW, now everything is back to normality, Pacman,
  Galaxians, Centipede, and others.  I have learned a thing:  never work until
  4.30am in the morning :>

- Thanks to Gary Walton, Nicola added 100% correct colors in Mr Do's Castle
  Fixed also a bug in Ghosts 'n Goblins hiscore saving.  Now GnG does the
  self test too.

- Some credits that were left out in this file only, last time:  Thanks to
  Al Kossow, Hedley Rainnie and Eric Smith for the code to their vecsim
  emulator which had emulated these games previously on the unix and the mac,
  and thanks to Neil Bradley for pointing out the critical bug in the vector
  generator engine which prevented Tempest from working.

- Super Pac Man and Mappy have correct pitch now (thanks Aaron and Satoh).
  Also, SuperPac has speed cheat control again.

- Frogger doesn't have garbled chars anymore, and Galaga has correct stars
  speed now.

- Added support for KickRaider.  It's a rom swap, same hardware of Mr. Do
  Wild Ride.

- Patrick Lawrence added trackball sensitivity setting menu

- Morten Eriksen added hiscore save support to Arabian and AntEater

- Sound is back on williams games too

- Changed Dig Dug Atari rom dir into "digdugat", indicating the correct
  roms archive name.


==========================================================================

0.26

- After so much time of hard work the policy of "back to quality" is starting
  to bring back the efforts.  I'm proud to announce I'v beated Mr Do's Castle.
  Done one, done all.  So now we have also Mr Do! RunRun and Mr Do! Wild Ride.
  Thanks to the invaluable help of Nicola, they are also arcade colors perfect,
  very fast (!) and each game has audio support and hiscore saving! :D

- Me and Aaron Giles (agiles@mail1.sirius.com) have added support for MAPPY!!
  One of the most requested games.  It was a pleasure working with Aaron!  He
  also added sound support and very close arcade colors (I think to have found
  the color_prom... if it's the correct prom it will be added in the next
  release).  Hiscore saving is supported as well.

- Thanks to the outstanding combined efforts of Brad Oliver, Bernd Wiebelt
  and Allard Van Der Bas, MAME entered in vectorial emulation world! (YEAH!!!)
  All in a time, we have support for Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe, Black Widow
  Battlezone, Gravitar, Lunar Lander, Red Baron, Spaceduel, Tempest!!!

- Again Aaron Giles added sound support to Super Pac Man!

- Patrick Lawrence (pjl@ns.net) did a great work adding trackball support to
  the main core system.  Trackball is enable with -trak parameter.  Trackball
  support has been added to Centipede and Reactor.  Also, Patrick provided
  a driver for Crystal Castles.  Great Work! ;)

- And three... Aaron added support for Dig Dug!!  Hey man, you'r at a step
  to become a God of Arcade emulation ;)

- Mike Coates has joined to the "back to quality" team.  He added support for
  SeaWolf ][, and improved Space Zap and Gorf (which is still unplayable).
  Also Robby Roto is now fully playable (you'll need a bug free rom set).

- Ray Giarratana (ray@loop.com) added support for Missile Command.  I didn't
  include modifications for trackball for now.  The code needs to be cleaned
  a bit, but the game is still playable.

- Enrique Sanchez provided me documentation for Yie Air Kung Fu.  Also,
  Philip Stroffolino (phil@maya.com) sent me a more complete driver than
  mine for this game which is now playable.

- Eric Anschuetz fixed a bug in joystick redefinition menu.  Also added the
  selection support for Any Button ("A" key), and None ("N" key).

- Fabrice Frances added a driver for 3 Stooges.

- Andrew Scott provided a better sound support for Phoenix.  Melody is still
  missing, because Shaun's board doesn't have it.

- Nicola fixed Jump Bug driver which is now perfect.  Colors are still wrong
  without proms.

- Morten Eriksen (Morten.Eriksen@due.unit.no) added hiscore saving to
  Ghosts 'n Goblins.

- Valerio Verrando provided a new tweaked mode 256x232 for Crystal Castles.
  He also provided a new tweaked video mode to get vsynced 60Hz (perfect
  speed) with 256x256 games.  It has horizontal clock recover (thus video is
  less mashed vertically, without having to modify monitor settings, and it
  doesn't be confused with 224x288 by monitors that remember settings. Really
  nice on scrolling games:  try it with "-noscanlines -vsync -vgafreq 1"

- Fixed Commando dip switch bonus settings.  Also fixed a setting in Ant
  Eater dipswitch.

- Fixed a bug that locked your PC if BLASTER variable was not found (thanks
  to James Oliver for the suggestion).

- Tatsuyuki Satoh fixed sound tempo speed in Elevator Action (tempo speed
  is 37.5Khz).

- Added support for two versions of Pengo (one with the music of Popcorn
  and a clone).

Sources:
--------

- Me, Nicola, Bernd and Patrick have heavily changed the main core set of
  sources.  Improvements to speed, memory access, drivers structure were
  done.  We strongly suggest to developers to start their code on a clean
  0.26 version.

- Opcode decode and graphic decode are now done by a single function in
  one step.

- Tatsuyuki Satoh (tatuyuki@tky.threewebnet.or.jp) optimized DrawGfx()
  function in case TRANSPARENCY_PEN and TRANSPARENCY_COLOR without remap,
  producing a speed increment of 22-25% (try yourself with Elevator Action!)

- Mauro Minenna introduced a new option (-dir4) that simplify the use of
  the joysticks to be connected on the keyboard.  This modify resolves the
  problem of diagonal direction in games such as PacMan, Popeye, and Kung Fu
  Master.


==========================================================================

0.25

Program:
--------

- We have added Starforce!  Another one that rocks!!
  Sound is not supported yet.

- Finally I've added Tutankham.  (Hi Moose!! ;)  Moose provided me a good
  bunch of information and I lost much time on a stupid bug in bank selection.
  Thanks to David Dahl (techt@juno.com) that provided me a driver too, and
  I found the light!!  Also thanks to Rob Jarrett for the exaustive memory
  map (I've included it in sources, it's better than mine).

- I've decrypted the garbled graphics of AntEater and Rescue which are now
  fully playable.  And Fabio Buffoni improved the decode routines with
  thrilling code.  Colors are wrong, unless someone provides me a good
  set of screenshots to study.  Hunchback doesn't work yet.

- Nicola added a driver for Mysterious Stone.

- Sal and John Bugliarisi provided us technical information about the game
  Naughty Boy.  (Remember that code area is 64k long and not 32k).
  We have implemented a driver and for this game which is now supported.

- I took the time to add some high score saving.  So, now Junior Pacman,
  Naughty Boy, Tutankham, Kangaroo, have high score saving support.
  (So Dave will stop bothering me about that ;)  heheh!!!  Joking ;)

- Nicola fixed Commando driver, so now intermissions have the correct
  tiles positioned.

- Added JrPacman speed cheat.  It works in the same way of Pacman.
  (thanks to Hugo Pi for let me notice this).

- Chris Hardy added support for Space Firebird.  Thanks to Chris and to
  all Sage Staff.

- Nicola did some fixes to Taito Games (Jungle King and Elevator Action)
  about background placement and coins per credit dipswitch.  Plus vertical
  scroll support in Jungle King (used in ground shake), correct sprite
  priority, and no more rubbish is present during change of stage.
  Finally, he also added preliminar support for WildWestern and FrontLine,
  which are not yet playable.
  DELETE ELEVATOB\ELEVATOB.DSW, JUNGLEK\JUNGLEK.DSW, JHUNT\JHUNT.DSW,
  OTHERWISE THE GAME WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY.

- Eric Anschuetz proposed me to implement a different button layout for
  joysticks.  I replyed with a configurable joystick setup (like the
  keyboard one).  So Eric finished the work providing us a useful joystick
  setup menu.  Thanks Eric and Robert! ;)

- Refixed the galaga hiscore bug (it happened when syncing my sources with
  Nicola's ones)

- Maurizio Zanello provided a better interface between MAME and frontends.
  And now you can select frameskip rate even while playing, without have to
  exit.  Volume can be controlled with keypad PLUS and MINUS keys.

- Robert Anschuetz provided me info about how to enable a shot sample with
  moonquasar, mooncresta, galaxian and clones.

- Valerio Verrando fixed the Williams driver to support joystick in
  Blaster, Defender, Joust, Robotron, Splat, Stargate.  Also fixed the Space
  Invaders driver to include high score saving and 100% arcade-perfect colors
  for Lunar Rescue; since some bootleg machines did not use this colorful
  overlay, Destination Earth retains the Space Invaders color scheme.

- Bernd has cleaned up VESA command line options.
  No longer supported:
  '-vesascan'   --> use '-vesa' or (faster, if it works) '-vesa2l'
  '-vesaskip N' --> use '-640x480 -skiplines N'  instead
  '-rotate'     --> use '-rol' or '-ror' instead

  New:
  '-ror'
  '-rol'  Rotate the display (anti)clockwise.  Since this uses
          the standard VESA scanline mode, you'll get *vertical*
          scanlines on rotated games (authentic?).
  '-nodouble'
          prevents pixel doubling, if you like miniaturised
          arcade emulation. It's also faster than the standard
          pixel-doubling VESA modes.
  '-skiplines N'
          does what '-vesaskip N' used to do, except it does not
          select 640x480 VESA mode.

- Minor modifications to Arabian palette.  Ville Laitinen also provided some
  modifications to Kangaroo driver.

- Pause key back to 'P'.  Sorry, you cannot use it for your redefinitions,
  but, hey, you have 101 keys left!!! ;)

- Found the meaning of SW1 in Moon Cresta (Thanks to Mikiya Yadohisa)

- Added Crazy Kong bootleg version by Jeutel and Ms Pac Man Attacks clones

Sources:
--------

- Added an alternate 224x288 video mode (on my Matrox this produce correct
  aspect ratio with this tweaked mode).  To select it simply add -224 or
  -224x288 parameter.

- Nigel T. Barber  (Nigel.Barber@sgcs.co.uk) added mouse support.  We need
  some feedback, because each mouse device has its own sensitivity.  Enable
  mouse support with -mouse parameter.

- Time to use proper MAME fonts.  I draw a good looking complete set of
  chars to be used for messages and menu system in MAME.  Nicola changed
  the entire set of drivers and implemented a user interface sublevel
  (file is USRINTRF.C).

- Modifications done by Eric Anschuetz to add joystick reconfiguration
  menu.

- I'v changed the system configuration of each game.  Now a game saves all
  vital informations (DSW, KEY, and JOY settings) in a unique file with
  .CFG extension.  A backward compatibility is provided, so the first time
  MAME read previous settings and saves them in the .CFG file at exit/reset.

- Bernd changed the VESA code to provide '-rol' and '-ror'
  replacing '-rotate'. Rotation modes are now supported in all
  VESA resolutions. The '-nodouble' option prevents pixel doubling
  in VESA modes, resulting in more speed and a smaller display.


==========================================================================

0.24

Program:
--------

- Nicola added support for Jr. Pacman.  Decryption method provided by
  David Caldwell (david@indigita.com).  Colors should be 100% right too.
  Hiscore saving not supported yet.  Nicola also thanks Lee Taylor for
  help.

- I've found the decryption scheme for garbled chars of Lost Tomb which is
  now playable.  Colors are still wrong.

- Also, I've finally fixed my problems with ADPCM decoding, so now Kung Fu
  Master doesn't need separate samples anymore (I didn't distribuite them
  because of copyright on sounds).  The samples are now calculated during
  bootstrap of the game.

- Again Nicola added Turpin (Another version of Turtles) support.  Also
  colors are 100% correct the two games now.

- Fabrice Frences added support for Qbert Qubes.  Only hitch with the
  driver:  you have to reset (F3) the game at first time when the empty
  supreme noser table appears, then the table will be correctly filled.
  Alternatively, you can insert a coin before this empty table appears...
  Hiscore save not supported yet.

- New option in the setup menu: "CREDITS". It displays a list of the people
  who contributed to the current driver. I have surely left out many people,
  and apologize in advance for that. If you contributed to a driver and your
  name doesn't appear in the list, please let me know.

- Since many people asked for this and Bernd Wiebelt was so kind to do me
  this gift for my birthday, MAME has now -rotate option.  You'll have to
  turn your monitor (or your head (!) ;)

- Nicola fixed definetively Kung Fu Master driver which has now 100% perfect
  colors and sprite positioning.  Thanks to Paul Swan for color scheme.
  Original version (copyright Irem) is now supposed to be in 'kungfum'
  directory, while the bootleg (O.K.) is supposed to be in 'kungfub'.  Test
  mode doesn't work for bootleg version (as is right to be).
  Hi Score Support in each version as well.

- In Seicross now shots are enabled.  REMEMBER TO DELETE PREVIOUS .DSW FILE,
  AND SET "DEMO & DEBUG MODE" TO OFF, AND "SW7B" to 1.   Setting SW7B to 0
  will cause to play the game without FIRE facility.

- Marc LaFontaine provided drivers for Robotron, Splat, Defender, Joust,
  Stargate, Bubbles, Blaster and Sinistar.  Bubbles doesn't start, and
  Sinistar do weird things at startup.  The other games work very well,
  though.  For this version I provide a set of fonts that can be used
  to avoid jerkiness in williams games.  If you use zipped roms remember
  to include them in the ZIP files.

- Added SpaceZap support.  It is based mainly on WOW driver.  Mike Coates
  provided a more stable driver too.

Sources:
--------

- Bernd Wiebelt provided new Vesamodes:  320x240 and 512x384.  You can select
  a mode either by -X (e.g. -640) or -XxY (e.g. -640x480).  Also fixed a bug
  that caused -vesaskip 0 not to run properly.  Also added -rotate option.
  Also, any vesa mode in combination with -noscanlines option can be used
  to achieve correct aspect ratio on most monitors.  This method is of
  course slower, and can work flawlessy on P166+ class.

- Modifications to support Driver Description and Credits.

- Nicola added a new mode in drawgfx: TRANSPARENCY_THROUGH.  When background
  has a higher priority of sprites, it's a lot faster using this option than
  draw sprites and then apply a bitmap with TRASPARENT_COLOR.

- Fabrice Frances submitted a new faster I86 emulator.  The entire I86
  directory is changed, and most of Gottlieb games are now faster.

- Mike Coates provided a modification to COMMON.C to support multi bank
  characters.  It uses bits 8-15 of the charset array (short int - so
  hopefully at least 16 bits on all implementations) to signify bank number.

- Changed the PAUSE key to Scrl-Lock key.  This permits to redefinite the
  P key for playing.

- TO ALL CONTRIBUTORS:  Please do not make use of C++ // comments in your
  sources.  I loose a lot of time every release to adjust them.  Then use
  official source release as a base for your next updates.  Use a comment
  style like in Williams.c sources (this is actually my comment style and
  almost clear to read). Thanks.


==========================================================================

0.23

Program:
--------

- "And there was MUSIC!".  Thanks to Ishmair's FM engine, music is supported
  in Commando, Ghosts 'n Goblins, Diamonds.  Since the synthesis is based
  on FM generation via OPL, you must have a SoundBlaster, Adlib, or compatible
  to get the music.  However I heavily dislike this approach and I'm looking
  for documentation on FM generation.  If anyone want to join to the party
  forward me a mail!

- I've also fixed GALAGA hiscore saving, which is now flawlessy supported! ;)

- I've added Kung Fu Master driver to MAME.  Credits fly to Ishmair for the
  hardware information and to Nicola for fixing my sprite bugs.

- Steven Hugg (hugg@pobox.com) provided a Williams games driver.  Stargate,
  Robotron and Joust are currently supported and playable.  However Robotron
  and Joust have some glitches yet.

- Tormod Tjaberg (tormod@sn.no) provided several modifications to Invaders
  Deluxe driver which has now Hi-score Name saving feature (the only one
  Space Invaders Emulator doing so at the moment!).  All Invaders have now
  Tilt too.  Keys and Dip Switch adjusted.  REMEMBER TO DELETE PREVIOUS
  .DSW and .KEY FILES.

- John Butler and Ed. Muller provided a driver for QIX!  High Score saving
  supported too.

- Thankx to Dock Cutlip (dockc@cyberplanet.net) Pacman Plus has now 100%
  arcade correct colors.

- While talking of colors, Ghosts 'n Goblins has 100% correct colors too!
  Thanks to Gabrio Secco that provided us the complete colors LOG file ;)

- I've fixed Seicross which is now playable and has music too.  REMEMBER TO
  DELETE PREVIOUS .DSW FILE, AND SET "DEMO & DEBUG MODE" TO OFF.

- Also fixed Nibbler colors:  I should say 100% correct colors, but I
  remember the Nibbler hairs were Green versus Purple.  Maybe I played a
  bootleg version.

- Added Phoenix TPN clone ("phoenix3").  I've also added hiscore support to
  all Phoenix and Pleiads as well.

- Fixed the "ape" bug in Kangaroo.

- Full rotation allowed in Mad Planets (Thanks to Andrew Scott).

- Some fix to Popeye and Burgertime sound pitch.

Sources:
--------

- Modifications were done to M6809 emulator to support FIRQ.

- Changes were done to MSDOS.C to fix OSD_READ_KEY for people having
  problems with keyboard.

- Dip Switches and Key Settings are now selectable thru a menu system.
  F8 key is no longer supported.


==========================================================================

0.22

Program:
--------

- Nicola added COMMANDO!!  Another of my favourite games back to life ;)
  High score supported as well.  Original Sound is done by YM2203
  (FM synthesis) while now is done by 8910 (no FM).
  So music is not present.

- And here it is:  thanks to Roberto Ventura's superdetailed documentation
  I've added Ghost 'n Goblin support.  I lost one week because of a bug in
  the new 6809 emulator, so I switch back to the previous one.  Big thanks
  to Nicola that fixed some stupid bugs in color palette generation. ;)
  We need a skilled player.  READ THE README.TXT FILE!

- Another one added:  based on GnG hardware I've added Diamond Run support.
  Don't know if the banks mode switch is right, it's too slow for me
  to go further the first level!

- Added Vulgus support.  Colors are wrong unless I find the color proms.
  High score save supported.  I played around with Dip Switches: they are
  almost right, though, but there should be also a sound toggle while in
  attract mode.

- Rick Wirch (wirch@execpc.com) proposed a better optimization to Cpu_readmem
  and Cpu_writemem.  Speed results are good under DOS and Windows.

- Brad Oliver provided me a lot of suggestions to improve portability and
  fixed a lot of bugs.

- Paul Berberich fixed some colors of Congo Bongo.  They are not right but
  a lot better of the previous.  Screenshots could be useful.

- I have fixed colors in Centipede.  Thanks to Ivan Mackintosh for sending
  me the info.

- Nicola added cars in radar update of RallyX and improved color palette
  emulation in Bombjack which has now perfect colors.

- Fixed credit bugs in Elevator Action and Turtles.  REMEMBER TO DELETE
  THE PREVIOUS .DSW FILES OTHERWISE THE GAMES WON'T WORK PROPERLY!

- Added preliminary sound support to Elevator Action and Jungle King.
  Tarzan yell scream sample missing.

- Time pilot has now 100% correct colors (thanks Virtu-Al!).

- Some fixes to sprite priority in Frogger.

- Added high score support to Amidar, Frogger.

- Added Phoenix Amstar (clone) support, Pac Man Plus (clone) and fixed
  all Invader's clones bugs.  Also fixed charset of all Invader's clones.

Sources:
--------

- Changed CPUIntrf regarding readmem/writemem optimizations

- Minor fixes to some drivers

- Bernd Wiebelt provided modifications to MSDOS.C for Vesa 2.0 linear
  and banked extensions.  Also inline assembly double pixeling provided
  a faster approach on slower videocards.  Check the readme.txt file for
  new video options.


==========================================================================

0.21.5

- Nicola fixed a bug in Memory addressing that caused Galaga to trash
  under DOS.  Also, fixed colors in Elevator Action (100% correct colors)
  and Jungle King (I have some screenshots and colors doesn't match.  BTW
  these are much better than previous).  Finally Jungle King doesn't need
  to select the graphic bank, but still have some glitches on sprites.

- Fixed a bug in sound init of phoenix/pleiads that caused the game to
  crash under dos.

- Fixed a bug in keys redefinition routine:  ALT, SHIFT, and CONTROL are
  now selectable.

- Fixed 224x288 noscanline video mode.  It's centered again now.

Sources:
--------

- Changed MSDOS.C to support 240x272 (video mode provided by V.Verrando)

- Changes in COMMON.C to copyscrollbitmap()


==========================================================================

0.21

Program:
--------

- I'd like to say I've finished, but Nicola is too fast as always! ;)
  So thanks to Nicola we have GALAGA!!  And very special thanks to Martin
  Scragg that provided us crucial information on custom I/O chips.

- Thanks to Dark Schneider (DS wanted to be anonymous, so I'll call him
  this way) that provided 6809 support and the first driver working on this
  CPU: Super Pac Man.  The driver is based on the super-detailed KEG file
  of Replay emulator by Kevin Brisley (kevin@isgtec.com).
  Thanks to everyone.

- Ville Laitinen provided a driver for Kangaroo, based on the Arabian
  hardware.  I've also adjusted the number of frames per second to 60
  to the two drivers.  Sync with sound should be better, though.

- Thank to Virtu-Al (Alan J McCormick (gonzothegreat@JUNO.COM)) Amidar
  and Turtles now have 100% correct colors.

- Arabian has correct colors now.

- Fixed a bug in all games with starbackground:  using a frameskip > 0
  introduced slowdowns.  Now the speed remains unchanged.

- Fixed tempo speed in 1942.  It was playing at half speed. Should be
  correct now.  Also fixed a bug in noise volume of PSG.  Noise was
  playing at half volume.

- Added support for Donkey Kong japanese version

- Minor adjustment to Space Invaders color strips

- Mad Planets doesn't crash anymore with the new samples (shorter!)

- Added colors to Warp Warp.  Thanks again Chris.

- Fixed Dipswitch in Elevator Action.  YOU'LL HAVE TO DELETE THE PREVIOUS
  DSW FILE IN "ELEVATOB" DIRECTORY IN ORDER TO GET IT RUN CORRECTLY.

Sources:
--------

- Added M6809 CPU support.  Changes in CPUIntrf.c and Driver.h to accomodate
  the new CPU.

- Nicola introduced changes to the Z80 emulator code that intercept some
  sorts of tight loop used during an interrupt waitstate.  Normal games
  should not be affected, while Galaga and 1942 are now very fast!!

- Added MasterVolume in MSDOS.C, and changed MAME.C to support this feature.
  You can change the volume thru various volume percentage [100,75,50,25,0]
  pressing F9.

- Sound is freezed now during GFXView, Pause and DipSwitch settings.[Ahhh! ;)]

- I've added redefinable keys in MAME.  A new structure cointains which
  input ports and bits have a certain meaning.  The KEY settings will be
  saved in a .KEY file, in the game directory.

- Changes in COMMON.H for the sample structure.  Now it has infos on
  replayrate, resolution and volume of the sample to be played.
  BE SURE TO DOWNLOAD THE NEW SET OF SAMPLES, OR THE "MAMESAM" CONVERTER
  OR YOU WILL GET NO SOUND FOR SAMPLE BASED GAMES!!


==========================================================================

0.20

Program:
--------

- Yes!!  Finally I wrote a driver for Gyruss, one of my favourite games
  and one of the reasons why I started emulation.  Big special thanks
  to Michael Cuddy, without help and information this game would probably
  never be done;  and to Nicola Salmoria that fixed some of the sprites
  bugs that turned me mad and cleaned the code! ;)

- The following changes were done by Nicola Salmoria:
  - 1942 has correct colours.  Also fixed rom paging, so now it has no more
    slowdowns.  Fixed jerkiness.  Sound is better, too.  How about the
    tempo?  How about the pitch?  Are they right?
  - fixed missing sprites when exiting from doors in Elevator Action. There
    are still some sprite priority bugs.  Also better colors.
  - Thanks to Marc LaFontaine's invaluable help, Popeye is now fully playable
    and has 100% accurate colors.  Supports high score saving, too.
    Still very slow.

- Brad Oliver found a lot of bugs around the code.  Fixed 1942 background
  scroll, Arabian video driver, and Phoenix sound init routine (all those
  caused trashes on MAC).

- Paul Berberich fixed some colors of Donkey Kong that is now quite close
  to original arcade.  Also Donkey Kong Jr. has better colors now.

- Fabrice Frences provided a driver for Krull.  Also fixed some bugs in
  qbert, and returned audio to Mad Planets.

- Ron Fries created a new set of Donkey Kong samples, using Mike Cuddy's
  8039 emulator.  The new samples no longer have static, they are aliased
  and louder.  All names are now generic, so the same name can be used
  across Nintendo line (DK, DKjr, DK3, Mario).

- Chris Hardly kindly provided a working driver for Warp Warp.

- Dave W. provided a new set of invaders samples.  Should be better, though.

- Frogger music tempo bring back to original value.  Fast but flawless!

Sources:
--------

- Changed 8910intf to support 5 PSGs (Gyruss have them!)

- Changes in MAME.C:  added -list option.  This is useful for mantaining
  the readme file.  It lists currently supported games.  Thanks to Zanello
  Maurizio for suggestion.

- Changes in MSDOS.C:  vesa and vesascan are now mutex.  Also fixed a bug
  caused by calling joystick initialize before starting allegro.

- To UNIX users:  sorry for the mess I did in my previous distribuition.
  All names and patches should be ok now.

- Nicola Salmoria provided the following changes:
  - changed GENERIC.C to add sound_command_latch_r(): this always return the
    last command, instead of 0, if there are no more pending commands. This
    was required by 1942.

  - new flag for the cpu type: CPU_AUDIO_CPU. For example, you'll define a CPU
    type as CPU_Z80 | CPU_AUDIO_CPU. This indicates that the CPU is a slave
    used for audio only, and is therefore not needed if sound is disabled.
    The CPU will not be emulated when sound is turned off, therefore speeding
    up the emulation a lot.

  - also, 8910_sh_update() doesn't emulate the 8910 audio if sound is disabled
    (the I/O ports of the chip are still emulated, since some games use them
     for input).


==========================================================================

0.19

Program:
--------

- Thanks to Marc LaFontaine we have now support for Popeye.  It's not yet
  playable (when the game starts the machine resets) but it has music already.
  It's also very slow, since it uses a 512x480 screen.  I'm looking for
  decryption scheme for original Popeye board using Lionel's idea [pain!].

- Fabrice Frences fixed the Qbert driver and added support for Reactor.

- Jarek Burczynski provided a preliminar but playable driver for Arabian.
  Colors are wrong, but it support sound already.

- Mike Coates fixed the Space Panic background colors.  Also added hiscore
  support.

- Nicola Salmoria found how Elevator Action background works.  Also updated
  all drivers that have a scrolling background.  Support for the bootleg
  version of Elevator Action ("elevatob"). The original version doesn't
  work because of copy protection.  The graphics are almost OK now,
  albeit quite slow.

- Paul Leaman (author of the 1942 emulator) provided exhaustive information
  on (guess what) 1942, which is now supported.

- Some changes to music tempo of Frogger

- Added partial sound support to RallyX (no explosions yet). Thankx to Ron
  Fries.

- Added preliminar unplayable WarpWarp.  Graphic is ok, but the game hangs
  during diagnostic.

- Changed noise_lenght and noise_rate values in Moon Cresta audio driver,
  so now noise is much more noisier!

- Shaun Stephenson provided me original Phoenix sound samples, so I adjusted
  sound driver to achieve correct sound modulation and frequency, and
  substituted noise generator for shots and explosions with a couple of
  samples.  Noise generator can be still used (just don't put the samples
  in the directory) with Phoenix and it's used in Pleiads.  I changed
  white noise waveshape and adjusted frequency, so now it sounds better.

Source:
-------

- Added input ports 5 and 6 in CPUINTRF module.

- Fixes to setdipswitches() and the fps counter in COMMON.C, to make them
  work correctly with non 8x8 fonts.

- Substituted strcmp() with case insensitive stricmp() in MAME.C and MSDOS.C.
  This solve the problem with upcase gamename (ex: Win95 and NDOS).

- Added copyscrollbitmap() to COMMON.C, that semplifies programming for
  those games that use scroll.

0.18

IMPORTANT NOTE: This will be the last version of MAME released by me (Nicola
Salmoria). From now on, the project will be maintained by Mirko Buffoni
(mix@lim.dsi.unimi.it). Contact him if you have material to submit for
inclusion into MAME. Please don't send such material to me.


Program:
--------

- Green Beret:
  - The speed should now be VERY accurate. It also syncs correctly with the
    music.
  - Sound pitch should be correct as well (though it changes after you die
    for the first time...)
  - High score support.
  - Fixed sprite clipping problem on the left of the screen.
  - Fixed memory trashing bug in dirtybuffer handling

- I finally added some lousy, very inaccurate, noise to the 76496 emulator.
  This affects Lady Bug and Green Beret.

- I also added the same lousy noise to Galaxian, Pisces, Moon Cresta, Moon
  Quasar.

- Fixed bug in the 8910 emulation which caused noise to be played in Crazy
  Kong when you jumped over a barrel.

- Zaxxon and Congo Bongo now save their high scores for real. The code had
  disappeared from the drivers... I _did_ write it, since I had .hi files in
  my directories ;-)

- High score support in Space Invaders (Invaders only - not clones)

- Bomb Jack is much faster on a 486. Now runs very well with -frameskip 1 on
  my 486/100.

- Sprite placement in Pac Man, Ms Pac Man and Crush Roller should now be
  arcade perfect. Thanks to Richard Davies who verified it on a real machine.

- Preliminary support for Jungle King / Jungle Hunt. Slow but playable. I
  haven't the gfx bank selector, therefore you'll have to pick the correct
  background graphics yourself. Use keys C and V to change it.

- VERY preliminary support for Elevator Action. Not playable.

- Preliminary support for Seicross, using the Crazy Kong driver. Not playable.

- Marc Lafontaine fixed some problems in the Venture driver, and provided
  drivers for Mouse Trap and Pepper II, which run on similar hardware (Pepper
  II is not complete yet).
  Note that the required Venture ROM set has changed - the other one was
  missing one ROM.
  Collision detection doesn't work - in Mouse Trap, you can use keys 7 and 8
  to simulate a sprite-to-character and a sprite-to-sprite collision.

- Rotated the controls for Q*Bert

- Some changes to music tempo in Amidar, Pooyan, Time Pilot.

- Added support for the original, Universal version of Mr. Do!. I renamed the
  other, which has an additional Taito copyright notice, "mrdot".

- Support for a version of Crazy Kong running on Scramble hardware

- Mike Coates provided a Space Panic driver.

- Fixed bugs in Jump Bug and Bagman sound drivers which caused page faults
  when run under DOS.

- Fabrice Frances submitted a much faster version of the 8086 emulation.
  Q*Bert now runs at full speed with -frameskip 1 on my 486/100.

Source:
-------

- Samples are now loadaed by the main engine, not the single drivers. This is
  done via the new field samplenames in the GameDriver structure. Samples can
  then be retrieved by the drivers in Machine->samples.


==========================================================================

0.17

Program:
--------

- Various fixes to Green Beret:
  - Thanks to Paul Swan, it now has 100% accurate colors.
  - Dip switches didn't work, fixed.
  - Support for Rush'n Attack (the US version)
  - I've been told that it actually was too fast, so now it runs slower.
    Let me know how accurate it is.

- Fabrice Frances submitted a massive contribution: an 8086 CPU emulator, and
  drivers for Q*Bert and Mad Planets. They run quite slowly on my 486/100
  (~25 fps) but are playable. Q*Bert has sound too (with samples).


==========================================================================

0.16

Program:
--------

- Support for Green Beret, with partial sound (probably inaccurate).
  Colors are terrible. If you can see what you are doing, it's playable (but
  should it be this fast? I find it very hard)

- Richard Davies and Brad Oliver provided drivers for the so-called "Sega"
  version of Jump Bug (it's actually a bootleg with the protection checks
  removed). The driver supports sound.

- Added joystick support to Vanguard.

- Support for Fantasy on the Nibbler driver. There are several problems, it's
  not playable.

- Thanks to Mike Coates and Peter Clare, Carnival now has colors.

- Stefano Mozzi provided a much better palette for Mario Bros.

- Matthew Hillmer submitted a new palette for Donkey Kong 3. It is not
  intended to be correct, but at least it gets rid of the annoying
  checkerboard effect.

- Tormod Tjaberg provided updated Space Invaders (+clones) drivers which
  support sound. They use samples, derived from Michael Strutts' emulator.

- Support for Fantazia (bootleg version of Moon Cresta)

- Fixed a couple of remaining graphic glitches in the Wizard of Wor driver.

- Various fixes to Burger Time:
  - Fixed CPU clock speed to avoid slowdowns on fourth level.
  - It's much faster on a 486.
  - Sprites no longer "stick" on the screen on a level change.
  - Fixed a bug in high score save.
  DELETE BTIME\BTIME.HI, OTHERWISE THE HIGH SCORE TABLE WILL BE CORRUPTED

- Marc Lafontaine provided a Venture driver. It is partially playable,
  sprites are wrong.
  On startup, keep 1 or 2 pressed to proceed.

Source:
-------

- I wrote some general purpose routines to simplify interface with the AY8910.
  They are in 8910intf.c. See the existing drivers for usage examples.

- To solve the problem with garbled text messages in Time Pilot, modified the
  GameDriver structure replacing letters_start and numbers_start with the
  array charset[36].

- I finally took the time to change Z80.h/M6502.h to make them work together.
  This allowed me to remove some kludges in cpuintrf.c. I also added some new
  functions, which can be used regardless of the CPU type: cpu_getpc(),
  cpu_geticount(), cpu_seticount().

- Fixed a couple of bugs in M6502 BCD arithmetic. One of them was causing the
  pepper counter in Burger Time to behave strangely.

- Brad Oliver modified pokey.c and pokey.h to make them more portable.


==========================================================================

0.15

Program:
--------

- Jarek Burczynski submitted a sound driver for Bomb Jack.
  The game is now a bit slow on my 486/100, -frameskip 1 is almost good but
  not quite.

- Sound support in:
  Scramble
  Super Cobra (note that the "scobra" rom set is wrong - ROMs 5c, 5d and 5e
               must be 2k, not 4k. You can take them from one of the other two
			   sets).
  The End
  Battle of Atlantis
  Lost Tomb (very nice sound, pity the ROMs are corrupted)
  Amidar
  Turtles
  Frogger
  Pooyan
  Time Pilot

  All these require -frameskip 1 on my 486/100.

  I have no idea how accurate the tempo and pitch is. If you can compare it
  with a real machine, please let me know what's wrong.

  Note: I discovered that the garbled sound I experienced in Scramble was
  caused by a bad ROM. Therefore, if sound doesn't work, check your ROM
  set. Note that I also changed one ROM name from "2c" to "2d".

- Carnival is finally working! Many thanks to Richard Davies who understood
  how to make it accept coins.

- Brad Oliver deserves a prize for being the person who, alone, has
  discovered more bugs than everyone else put together. This time the bug
  was illegal memory acesses in games using 224x288 and 288x224 modes (Pengo,
  Pac Man, Rally X).

- Thanks to the invaluable help of Steve Scavone, I've been able to fix
  many bugs in the Wizard of Wor driver.

- Added support for a version of Galaxian which is known to be original. It
  has Namco copyright and the code is slightly different from the other
  Galaxian (which has Midway copyright). I called this version "galaxian",
  and renamed the other "galmidw".

- High score support in Pac Man, Ms. Pac Man, Crush Roller, Burger Time,
  Zaxxon, Congo Bongo, Pooyan, Moon Cresta, Moon Quasar.

- Support for a different version of Frogger ("frogsega").

- Miscellaneous graphics fixes to Zaxxon and Congo Bongo. Also better colors
  (especially in Congo Bongo), thanks to Marc Lafontaine.

- Fixed most of the graphics problems with Moon Patrol. The video driver is
  a gigantic kludge right now, but it works and at a reasonable speed
  (though I can't reach 60fps on my 486/100).

- Many people requested a way to syncronize with the video beam, to avoid
  jerkiness. Here it is: -vsync. It should be used together with -noscanlines,
  and possible -vgafreq to adjust the frame rate to be as close as possible
  to 60fps (use F11 to check the actual frame rate). Note that this, unlike
  the default timer based sync, will NOT downgrade nicely if your system is
  not fast enough.

- Bernd Wiebelt provided new code for -vesascan, and implemented the new
  "-vesaskip n" mode. It uses a 640x480 screen instead of the 800x600 used
  by -vesascan, and allows you to scroll the visible area using the PGUP and
  PGDOWN keys.

- Maintaining the endless list of ROM subdirectories was getting quite boring,
  so I modified readroms() to make it automatically print the complete list of
  required ROMs if one is missing. I think I should add a CRC check as well.
  I also added a brief explanation of what ROMs are and why they are required -
  hoping this will cut down the flow of e-mail asking "gee, I run your program
  and it says 'unable to open file xxxx/xxxx', what should I do?"


==========================================================================

0.14

Program:
--------

- Fixed bug in Mario Bros. high score loading: it was recovering the high
  score table, but the high score at the top of the screen was not set
  accordingly.

- Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong 3 now also preserve the score distributions
  (use F1 to see them)

- High score support in Galaxian, Time Pilot, Centipede and Millipede.
  However, high scores don't seem to work in Millipede (you are not asked
  to enter your name).

- Fixed bug which sometimes caused 6502 games not to run (actually they did
  run, but interrupts didn't happen).

- Since the US version is better, I renamed amidar to amidarjp, and
  amidarus to amidar.

- Renamed pleiades to pleiads.

- The change in video modes suggested by ue303ey@sunmail.lrz-muenchen.de
  didn't work on some systems, so I reverted to the previous one.

- Ron Fries provided a new version of his Pokey emulator which fixes problems
  in the interface with the SEAL audio library (signed vs. unsigned samples).

- Ron Fries also added preliminary sound support to Donkey Kong! It uses some
  very bad samples for now. The samples are distributed in a separate archive
  - put them in the dkong subdirectory.

- Richard Davies updated the audio routines in Phoenix, sound is now closer
  to the original and noise is emulated.

- Brad Oliver and Mirko Buffoni provided a driver for Vanguard, based on Brian
  Levine's Vanguard emulator.

Source:
-------

- driver.c was getting much too large and confused. I moved the GameDriver
  structures inside the single driver/xxxx.c files. This has the additional
  benefit that people sending me drivers will not forget to include the ROM
  loading addresses ;-)

- I also changed the GameDriver structure, moving there fields from the
  MachineDrivers structure. The idea is that MachineDriver should describe
  the hardware, while GameDriver the software. Therefore things like colors
  (which are usually stored in a PROM) and dip switch settings go into
  GameDriver; decode_color_prom, on the other hand, goes into MachineDriver
  because it is an hardware function.
  It could be argued that input_ports belong to the hardware; but sometimes
  we have keys tied to dip switches (test switches and so on) whose function
  is determined by the software. Moreover input_ports contains the default
  values for all ports, including dip switches, and those are definitely
  software related.


==========================================================================

0.13

Program:
--------

- Added the most frequently asked feature: high score saving. Check the
  table at the beginning of readme.txt to see which games already support
  it.
  High scores are also reset-proof: you can reset the game by pressing F3
  without losing them. To reset the high scores to their default, just
  delete xxx\xxx.hi where xxx is the game name.
  Note that hi score saving will NOT work if the default hi scores have been
  modified in the ROMs. Use the original ROMs.

- Fixed all of the problems in Burger Time related to ROM encryption. Slices
  fall more than one level when an enemy is on them, no more crashes when a
  bonus life is earned, the high screen table works, two players mode works,
  and other things.

- Support for an alternate ROM set for Burger Time, which is likely an
  earlier version.

- Millipede's dip switches now work.
  DELETE MILLIPED\MILLIPED.DSW, OTHERWISE THE GAME WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY.

- Marc Lafontaine submitted a new palette for Zaxxon.

- Richard Davies provided a new Phoenix/Pleiads driver with partial sound
  support.

- Fixed "froggers" (I broke it while adding sound to Scramble).
  It now also uses the correct palette. Yes, I know that it is completely
  different from the real Frogger. This is a bootleg version, remember.

- As promised, I modified the 8910 emulator to set the clock frequency at run
  time, so sound in Crazy Climber and Crazy Kong is now back as normal.

- ue303ey@sunmail.lrz-muenchen.de reports that changing the horizontal total
  register of the custom video modes (0x3d4, 0x00) from 0x5f to 0x61 makes
  them work on his monitor. I experimentally made the change.
  IF THE CUSTOM MODES WORKED FOR YOU IN VERSION 0.12 AND THEY DON'T WORK ANY
  MORE, PLEASE NOTIFY ME AND I WILL REVERT TO THE PREVIOUS SETTING.

- Keith Smethers suggested to add -vgafreq n command line parameters,
  to select the VGA clock frequency. This may reduce flicker, especially in
  the 224x288noscanlines mode.
  WARNING: THE FREQUENCIES USED MIGHT BE WAY OUTSIDE OF YOUR MONITOR RANGE,
  AND COULD EVEN DAMAGE IT. USE THESE OPTIONS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

- I began working on Moon Patrol's background. It's quite messed up now.

- Fixed a couple of minor bugs in Bomb Jack background colors.

Source:
-------

- Use latest version of Marat's 6502 engine.

- Changes to struct GameDriver to accomodate the high score saving functions.
  I also moved the decryption pointers at the end, so it is not necessary to
  explicitly define them as 0 when they are not needed.
  Check driver.c to see how high score handlers should be written.
  hiscore_load() is called every vblank until it returns nonzero; this allows
  it to wait for the hi score table to be fully initialized before replacing
  it. To avoid saving an incomplete table, hiscore_save() is called only
  if hiscore_load() previously returned nonzero.


==========================================================================

0.12

Program:
--------

- Sound support in Burger Time. This is the first multiple CPU game supported
  by MAME (two 6502, one for code, one for sound).
  It's not perfect, but we're getting there.
  Also, as you can guess, this is slow. A 486/100 cannot handle it at 60 fps.
  Runs reasonably with -frameskip 1, though.

- I also set up the second CPU to emulate sound in Scramble, but the sound
  that comes out is completely wrong. I don't know what I'm missing, anyone
  can help?

- Since the 8910 emulator doesn't allow to set the clock frequency at runtime,
  I temporarily switched to using the default one. This affects sound in Crazy
  Climber, Crazy Kong and Bagman. Let me know whether it's better or worse
  than before.

- Sound in Centipede, through Ron Fries' POKEY emulator.

- Fixed speed in Burger Time (was running at about half the real speed).

- Valerio Verrando provided 288x224 video modes to be used with Rally X.
  WARNING: these video modes might be unstable (the noscanlines one hangs my
  system). Any help to make them better would be appreciated.
  As usual, if the default mode doesn't work on your system, try -noscanlines.
  If that doesn't work as well, use -vesa.

- I finally found out what was causing slowdowns in Rally X and Bagman. It was
  an interrupt related issue (see later). I hope I didn't break a dozen of
  other games to fix this ;-)

- Thanks to Mike Cuddy and Mirko Buffoni, Pooyan colors are now MUCH better ;-)
  I also fixed a bug in the dip switches.
  MAKE SURE TO DELETE POOYAN\POOYAN.DSW, OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY.

- I suddenly realized that Time Pilot runs on the same hardware as Pooyan, so
  I made a driver for it. Colors come straight from Mike Cuddy's emulator.

- Gary Walton confirms that the colors in Moon Cresta and Moon Quasar are 100%
  accurate. Very good!

- The background stars in Scramble / Super Cobra now blink. However I don't
  know how close to the real thing it is.

- Ville Laitinen pointed out that The End runs on Scramble hardware, so it now
  uses the same driver. He also fixed problems with the input controls and two
  players modes.
  IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE TO DELETE THE FILES SCRAMBLE\SCRAMBLE.DSW AND
  THEEND\THEEND.DSW, OTHERWISE THE GAMES WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY.

- Ville also fixed sprite priorities in Congo Bongo.

- Doug Jefferys provided the color PROMs for Crazy Kong, so colors are now 100%
  accurate (with the possible exception of Kong itself, which uses a separate
  palette).

- Support for Moon Ranger (bootleg version of Moon Patrol).

- Added support for Lost Tomb (Stern game running on Super Cobra hardware),
  but it doesn't work well (crashes during the demo, and it's not playable) and
  the graphics are garbled. I think some of the ROMs might be corrupted.

- Preliminary support for Jump Bug. It uses a modified Scramble driver, the
  hardware seems to be similar. It's not playable (the input bits are not even
  mapped), and resets after a few seconds.
  I'm not particularly interested in this game, anyone volunteers to complete
  the driver?

- Support for the version of Super Cobra with Stern copyright.
  NOTE THAT I RENAMED THE OTHER ONE (Konami copyright) "scobrak".

- Ivan Mackintosh provided a Millipede driver (dip switches are not supported
  yet). Sound doesn't work, I don't know why.

- Brad Oliver provided a preliminary version of the Mr. Do's Castle driver. Not
  working yet!

- Mike Coates pointed out that Carnival uses a RAM for character generation
  (like Nibbler) and provided a driver for it. It's still not playable, but
  the graphics are now correct.

- Bernd Wiebelt suggested to add a new option: "-vesascan". It uses a VESA
  800x600 screen to simulate scanlines. It is much slower than the other video
  modes. Use this if you want scanlines and the default video mode doesn't
  work.

Source:
-------

- Multiple CPU support. All you have to do to setup multiple CPUs is add
  entries to the cpu[] array in the MachineDriver definition. Each CPU can
  have different type (currently Z80 and M6502 are supported), clock, address
  space, memory/IO port hook, interrupt handlers, number of interrupts per
  video frame.

- Sometimes interrupt requests happen while interrupts are disabled. Until now
  I just ignored them, but some games need them to be processed as soon as
  interrupts are reenabled. Rally X is an example of such a game. The Z80
  engine has provision to do that, but it would make writing a driver more
  complex (need to find the interrupt acknowledge register) so I slightly
  modified the engine to automatically cache an interrupt request and execute
  it as soon as interrupts are enabled. I had already done a similar change to
  the 6502 engine, it was needed by Burger Time which wouldn't accept coins
  otherwise.

- Since the functions xxx_vh_start(), xxx_vh_stop(), xxx_videoram_w(),
  xxx_colorram_w() are the same for most video drivers, I moved them,
  alongside with some variables, to vidhrdw/generic.c. This doesn't reduce
  much the size of the executable, but greatly reduces the amount of code that
  has to be put in a video driver (in many cases, you just have to write
  xxx_vh_screenrefresh())

- Fixed bug in msdos.c/osd_play_streamed_sampled() which prevented it from
  handling more than one audio stream. This part of the code still needs a
  major cleanup.

- Fixed bug in drawgfx() which sometimes allowed transparent non remapped
  copies to be drawn outside of the clip region.


==========================================================================

0.11

Program:
--------

- Moon Patrol support. There is no scrolling background because I don't know
  where to place it... can anyone provide a screen snapshot?

- Burger Time and Donkey Kong 3 drivers provided by Mirko Buffoni.
  The colors for Burger Time should be accurate, but I'm not quite sure -
  can anyone confirm?

- Fixed joystick controls for Congo Bongo.

- Lionel Theunissen dumped the color PROM of his Uniwars board and... it's
  different from the one provided by Gary Walton. Galaxian boards were widely
  pirated so it's difficult to determine which one is the "correct" palette.
  What I did was set the Uniwars driver to use one palette, and the "Japanese
  Irem" to use the other. Play the one you prefer.

- Marc Vergoossen provided a much better palette for Zaxxon.

Source:
- increased the maximum size of the graphic elements that can be handled by
  decodegfx() from 32x32 to 64x64. Actually I would have needed 256x64 to do
  Moon Patrol backgrounds, but that seemed slightly overkill ;-)


==========================================================================

0.10

Program:
--------

- Centipede support. This is the first 6502 game supported by MAME. I'm
  currently using Marat Fayzullin's engine.

- Nibbler support. This is the second 6502 game supported by MAME ;-)
  Interesting hardware: no sprites, two playfields, and it uses RAM for
  character generation (redefining the characters to animate the worm).

- I had also broken Pleiades, fixed. That's the drawback of emulating more
  than 60 games, I can't check them all before releasing a new version ;-)

- Ville Laitinen provided a Congo Bongo driver! The colors are terrible ;-),
  but it's playable.

- Thanks to Valerio Verrando, now -noscanlines works on Pac Man and the other
  games using a 224x288 screen. If you have problems with the default video
  mode try this one, it will hopefully solve them.

- I received no less than three different palettes for Donkey Kong Jr., from
  Brad Oliver, Marc Vergoossen and Richard Davies. The one included is from
  Marc.

- Thanks to Gary Walton and Simon Walls, we now have 100% accurate colors in
  Crush Roller and Uniwars/Japirem. Moon Cresta and Moon Quasar might be
  correct as well, but I'm not sure.

- Fixed a small graphics glitch in the background of Bomb Jack's third level.
  Thanks to Philip Chapman for the report.

Source:
-------

- Support for 6502 CPU. From a driver writer point of view, it is used just
  like the Z80, the only difference being that you have to specify CPU_M6502
  instead of CPU_Z80 in the MachineDriver definition.
  Multiple CPUs are still NOT supported.

- New function in common.c: decodechar(). It was originally part of
  decodegfx(), and is used to convert one single char from the machine format
  to the one used by the emulator. This function was needed by the Nibbler
  driver to dynamically convert the graphics at runtime.


==========================================================================

0.91

Program:
--------

- OK, even this time I managed to screw up one game (Phoenix). It works again.
  I'm not updating the source, you can fix it yourself if you need to: the line
     ROM_LOAD("phoenix.49", 0x2000, 0x0800)
  in driver.c was missing the '2'.


==========================================================================

0.9

Program:
--------

- Bomb Jack support.

- Background graphics in Zaxxon now work, albeit a bit slow (45-50 fps on my
  486/100)

- Support for the original version of Super Cobra. Note that I renamed the
  other one (which is a bootleg) "scobrab".

- Support for the original Moon Cresta (Nichibutsu copyright). These ROMs are
  encrypted, and slightly different from the other version. This is very
  likely the version Chuck Cochems remembers (with aliens teleporting right in
  front of your ship). I renamed the other version (which looks like a mix of
  the code from a bootleg version and the graphics from the Gremlin original
  version) "mooncrsb".

- Space Invaders now seems to work correctly. Deluxe version still doesn't
  work properly.

- F12 to take a snapshot of the gfx set (displayed using F4) now works.

- Better colors in Donkey Kong Jr. (thanks to Brad Oliver)

- Thanks to Gary Walton, Moon Quasar dip switches now are correctly described
  in the dip switch menu.

- F11 is now a toggle, also added F10 to turn off speed throttling (toggle as
  well)

Source:
-------

- The memory handling was no longer up to the task, so I had to make it more
  flexible.
  RAM is no longer a static array; it is dynamically allocated by readroms(),
  split in memory regions (one for the CPU addressing space, one for graphics
  ROMs, and so on) so data not needed at run time, like the graphics data, can
  be unloaded from memory after conversion. The definition and usage of struct
  RomModule and struct GfxDecodeInfo has changed. struct RunningMachine
  contains an array of pointers to memory regions.
  RomModules are now defined using macros, and readroms() does some error
  checking as well. This greatly reduces the chance of making a silly mistake.

  And don't ask me why, but as a result of this change the emulation seems to
  run much faster than before!

- New rom_decode function pointer in the GameDriver structure. It is used to
  decrypt the whole ROMs after loading them (as opposed to opcode_decode,
  which is used to decrypt only CPU opcodes).
  Also, opcode_decode is now handled differently: instead of calling it at
  runtime when the CPU reads an opcode, another 64k of memory are allocated
  and the whole ROMs decrypted. opcodes are then fetched from this new array.
  This approach is less flexible, for example it cannot handle code created
  in RAM (Pengo does that). However, it is MUCH faster (finally I get 60fps
  in Crazy Climber!), so I'll go with it for now. Should the need arise for
  a more flexible decryption, we'll think about it.

- Some changes to the MachineDriver definition and mame.c needed to support
  multiple CPUs (they are NOT supported yet - this is just the first step)


==========================================================================

0.81

Program:
--------

- Sorry about screwing Donkey Kong Jr. colors... it's playable again. Colors
  are still way off though: anyone volunteers to fix them? ;-)

- Zaxxon now works, but the background graphics are missing


==========================================================================

0.8

Program:
--------

- Added some support for Carnival - it boots and runs the demo, but the
  graphics are messed up.

- Fixed graphics in Moon Quasar (yes it does run, but you need the correct
  ROMs)

- Better error checking in the sound initialization routines. It still sucks,
  but at least will notify of problems instead of locking up the emulation.
  The "0. Silence" driver also works.

- Removed the "-nosound" command line switch, replaced it with "-soundcard n"
  which allows to bypass the audio driver selection menu. Use "-soundcard 0"
  to turn off sound.

- Some support for Space Invaders (+ some clones) but it doesn't work well.

- Support for Battle of Atlantis (a Scramble hack)

- The ROM copyright notice is displayed in the main emulation screen.

- Maybe I understood how the character colors are selected in Donkey Kong, at
  least in part, but I'm not sure. Anyway, I started fixing them. I based on
  the Kong emulator by Gary Shepherdson.


  Following changes provided by Mirko Buffoni:

- You can view the game graphics pressing F4. Use cursor keys to change
  graphics set/color, F4 to return to the game.

- Support for Mario Bros. (wrong colors, no sound) and Zaxxon (doesn't work yet).

- Better colors in Amidar and Frogger.

Source:
-------

- Added visible_area to the MachineDriver definition. It was used in all video
  drivers, so it's better to keep it centralized.

- Long-awaited function clearbitmap(), which correctly initializes a bitmap
  using background_pen. Note for people porting MAME to other systems:
  osd_create_bitmap() must call this function, the video drivers rely on that.

- I got rid of machine.c and put all into mame.c... when I have time, I'll try
  to organize the source better.


==========================================================================

0.7

Program:
--------

- Support for:
  Super Cobra (version running on a modified Scramble board)
  Amidar US version
  Crazy Climber Japanese version
  Pooyan (wrong colors, no sound)
  Phoenix/Pleiades (no sound)

- Scramble has 100% correct colors. The same palette is used by Super Cobra,
  but it doesn't look right.

- Gorf and Robby Roto boot but don't work.

- Added some support for Moon Quasar, but it doesn't work. Since the ROMs are
  encrypted, I don't know if this is due to wrong decryption, bad ROM, or
  wrong driver (I'm using the Moon Cresta one). I think that either MQ3 (which
  maps at 1000-17ff) is bad, or it uses a different encryption.


==========================================================================

0.6

Program:
--------

- Support for:
  Scramble (wrong colors, no sound)
  Uniwars (US version of Japanese Irem game)
  Frogger (including bootleg version running on a Scramble board)
    (wrong colors, no sound)
  Amidar (wrong colors, no sound)
  Turtles (wrong colors, no sound)
  Rally X (wrong colors, no sound, slowdowns)

- I'm beginning to understand how the Wizard of Wor video hardware works,
  gameplay hasn't changed but the graphics are more faithfully reproduced.

- Star background in Galaxians & co. The way I calculate it is probably not
  correct, anyway it looks reasonable.

- Fixed staccato notes in Pacman and other games using the same hardware.
  There are still some minor glitches (especially in Ms. Pac Man) but Pac Man
  tunes are now very close to the original.

Source:
-------

- I reorganized the source directory tree, instead of one directory for every
  game there are now four directories (drivers, machine, vidhrdw, sndhrdw)
  which contain files named after the game.


==========================================================================

0.5

Program:
--------

- Fixed some problems in the Wizard of Wor driver, but it is still far from
  complete.

- Support for:
  Donkey Kong Jr. (wrong colors, no sound)
  Galaxians and the plethora of clones (correct colors, limited sound)
  Pisces (correct colors, limited sound)
  "Japanese Irem game". I believe the colors are correct, but since I've
    never seen the original game I can't know for sure.
  War of the Bugs (wrong colors, limited sound)
  Moon Cresta (wrong colors, limited sound)
  The End (wrong colors, no sound)

- By popular demand, reverted to the old AY-3-8910 emulation code.

Source:
-------

- Changed readroms() to allow scatter loading of a single ROM. This was needed
  for Donkey Kong Jr. Now the end of the RomModule array is marked by a size==0,
  while name==0 means "continue loading the previous ROM at this address".

- Some bug fixes and changes to reduce porting problems (thanks to Brad Oliver)

- New function copybitmap() in common.c. Limited for now, will change in the
  future.


==========================================================================

0.4

Program:
--------

- Bagman support (wrong colors)

- Early Wizard of Wor support (not playable).

- New experimental AY-3-8910 sound emulation code provided by Andy Milne
  (andy@canetics.com). This sounds better in some places and worse in others.
  It is used by Crazy Climber, Crazy Kong and Bagman. Let me know what you
  think.

Source:
-------

- Optimizations in drawgfx(), Mr. Do!'s title screen and intermissions now
  run faster, Crazy Climber and Crazy Kong benefit as well.

- Use version 1.1 of Z80Em by Marcel de Kogel. Faster!
  (note that I had to make a couple of changes to Z80.c to make Crazy
  Climber work).

- Handle IN and OUT instructions in the same way as memory accesses (table
  of handler functions). The parameters of the functions are the same, so
  the same function can be used both for memory and ports.
  Had to change the driver structure, removed the pointers to _in and _out
  functions and added port_read and port_write array pointers.
  Also defined a generic interrupt_vector_w() function, this makes the Pac
  Man driver tinier (look at pacman/machine.c, it's now there only to handle
  the cheat).


==========================================================================

0.3

Program:
--------

- Donkey Kong support (wrong colors, no sound)

- New definition of custom video modes, this will hopefully be compatible
  with more systems.

- Lady Bug and Crazy Climber should run a little faster on slow machines
  (Crazy Climber is still too slow, I know).

Source:
-------

- new general purpose readinputport() function used to handle reads of
  input ports and dip switches. This saves some work when creating a
  game driver. Required changes to struct MachineDriver.

- struct GfxLayout now contains a planeoffset array instead of
  planeincrement, to better support more than 2 bitplanes. I also fixed
  (I hope) all the code which assumed 2 bitplanes. struct GfxDecodeInfo
  had to be changed as well.
