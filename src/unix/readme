TODO:
	- Sound support under SunOS ( should be easy, basically is the same
	  code that solaris one, but no time (and no machine) to test..... )

	- Rewrite audio code under *ix. No more Timer alarms to fill audio
	  buffer, please ( to many sync problems and audio "glitches" )

	- Need to improve speed. ( too slow if frameskip not used )

	- Multiuser support ( two users in two machines sharing game )

( Yes, I'm asking for help )

	Several things:

a) Actual code is very time-critical. You'll have to edit and recompile 
several times to find correct values for audio's device buffer size and
AUDIO_TIMER_FREQ #defined variable. Remember that audio buffer cannot
exceed 8192 bytes or solaris kernel will bypass your selection

b) There are at least two audio drivers in Sparc machines. the one based 
on amd73c90 chipset ( on 1,1+,2,SLC,IPX machines ) cannon run at 22Khz
linear encoding. So a little trick is used. Special thanks to people 
involved in ISABEL proyect for help and code to convert to ulaw encoding
( see ISABEL proyect on http://www.dit.upm.es/~proy/isabel/index.html )

c) In general, sound code under *IX should be rewritten. The basic idea is
to use *ix kernel features to poll data into audio buffers instead of
use timer alarms. I'm working on them. These method should eliminate problems
of synchronization and "glitches" due to non-constant audio input data stream
The use of timers tend to waste expensive cpu time and slow down performance
( specially under "Sun's SlowLARIS" )
